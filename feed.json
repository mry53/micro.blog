				"content_html": "<p>Angie, again\n<em>a story</em></p>\n<p>David Pearl sighed with relief. Travel was not his favourite way to spend his time, and he was ready to relax. He opened the door to the apartment, walked in, and pushed the door closed with his foot.</p>\n<p>He called out but heard no response. Instead, he found a cold and echoing apartment. He dropped his travel bag in the hall and wandered through the rooms, wondering why it felt so strange. The answer came when he saw the open and newly emptied bedroom closet.</p>\n<p>On the otherwise bare table he found a folded slip of paper, an abrupt goodbye comprised mainly of an accounting of the things Christine felt were within her rights to remove.</p>\n<p>At least she had the grace not to recount his personal failings on paper. There was no need to; she had already performed an adequate job of doing that verbally. After hearing her repeated accounts of his deficits he began to wonder why she persisted in their relationship. These thoughts he kept to himself to avoid further inflaming the smouldering ashes of a once warming relationship.</p>\n<p>Now he had his answer. She no longer persisted.</p>\n<p>The perfidy of it; of Christine. Go away for a few days and come back to find your life turned upside down. And you have no recourse, no voice in the sorry affair, and certainly no by-your-leave. It was a done deal. Such was the nature of betrayal, he thought bitterly.</p>\n<p>With a sigh, David turned and left. No way he would be able to relax at home now; he needed space, and time, to deal with the ruins of his former life. And walking was his usual method of thinking through issues, of finding an often meandering path through the thickets of life.</p>\n<p>He zipped his jacket against the light autumn breeze, and jammed his hands in his jeans pockets. Once he got moving he would warm up, but for the first few steps he hunched his shoulders and folded his body in on itself. It was not purely coincidence that his hunched body mirrored his mental scrunching. Without conscious effort he headed to the edge of town; to the refuge beyond. His respite; his gathering-thoughts place, where he could be alone within himself.</p>\n<p>After he passed between the stone pillars guarding the entry to the refuge David provided the only human activity to be seen. He shuffled through fallen leaves while his thoughts bounced between self-flagellation and self-righteous anger. He kicked at a small rock as he walked, chasing it across the path. It jumped and skipped around wildly, like the thoughts skittering across his mind.</p>\n<p>An acorn dropped onto a red leaf near the edge of the path. The leaf popped into the air as if startled by the fallen nut. At the rise of the little red leaf, David hesitated. From the corner of his eye he saw its&rsquo; startled movement. He realized he had been trudging along, head down, barely absorbing the sensory load of autumn. Unaware of the things around him. Just like Christine said.</p>\n<p>David’s refuge, a large wilds not far from town, was typically quiet and lonely. It did not draw many visitors; there were no real amenities, unless the presence of many trees counted as an amenity (which it should.) A meandering stream flowed under the trees and wound through the hills. Babbling water, chittering birds, and chattering squirrels broke the stillness of the wilds with their ever-present sounds.</p>\n<p>Roused by the motion of the red leaf, David raised his eyes and his turned his mind to the trees around him. Multi-hued leaves waved and fluttered in the crisp fall breeze, awaiting their turn to take the final plunge. Random patterns of light and shade dappling across the fluttering leaves created a natural kaleidoscope in all directions.</p>\n<p>He stopped and looked skyward. He began spinning around in a dizzying arc. Remembering that autumn was his favourite season, and that he was wandering through the wilds on a beautiful autumn day, weather-wise at least, he gradually became alert to the nature surrounding him.</p>\n<p>Across the slope of a hill he saw a glint of light scattering from the small pond. Low angle rays poking their way between hills and through tangled bare branches hit the surface of the water and bounced up to his eyes. Tracing the course of the rays from eyes to pond, and then upward through the trees, he was surprised at the low height of the sun. Could it really be nearing twilight already? He hesitated and looked about, turning through a full circle.</p>\n<p>The pond, like the quiet walls winding across the hills around it, had an air of ancient solitude. Things had happened here in some era now long gone. Stones carefully piled to form meandering walls attested to that. It must have been a lot of hard dirty manual labor, hauling and piling stones, rocks, boulders. All to clear fields and form walls. All to no avail. The soil, cleared of surface stones, yielded only more stones from within its bowels year upon year. Eventually, the slopes and valleys were yielded to nature. Now, the only sign that the natural order had once been disturbed was piled stones.</p>\n<p>The quietness of the autumn pond contrasted starkly with his memories of the clamour rising over it in the spring. Riotous spring, a gloriously fecund time of the year, seemed so long ago, so far away. Memories of spring contrasted starkly with the present autumn. David’s awareness returned to the current moment and his present life.</p>\n<p>He wanted to go back. Back to where, he could not really say. Back to somewhere not here, now. As usual, back was not an option. Not when the proverbial time machine was in the proverbial time machine shop. And if he got his hands on a working time machine he was likely to enter the wrong data, the wrong coordinates, and end up as dinosaur dinner. So he went on instead.</p>\n<p>A breeze puffed into his jacket. He pulled it closer. Strands of hair blew across his forehead and tickled the bridge of his nose. Should have grabbed a cap before setting out on his little trek, he thought.</p>\n<p>‘Always full of acute hindsight,’ he added.</p>\n<p>Tramping on through skittering leaves, he came to the top of a hill. Before him lay a small bowl-shaped valley, rimmed with colour and alive with flutters and dashes of blowing leaves. Suddenly, he felt a sharp rap on the top of his head. He took a small jump sideways and simultaneously reached up to the point of impact. The offending acorn continued its descent, its initial trajectory only slightly altered by the obstacle momentarily posed by his head.</p>\n<p>He rubbed the bruised nob on his head. Almost automatically, David became self-conscious. Even though he was quite alone, a ridiculous notion, an autonomic response, seized his mind. Did anyone notice the indignity?</p>\n<p>Ridiculous. There was no one around. And even if there was, so what? It would not matter.</p>\n<p>He relaxed. He had not seen anyone since he reached the wilds and set foot in front of foot, trudging across leaves and gravel, rocks and roots, for a couple kilometres along the path.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, an awareness crept over him. He was not alone. He felt it. He felt it before he knew it. He stopped, his nerves tingling. Still rubbing the top of his head, he slowly turned around. He saw nothing. Nothing but trees, hills, leaves ruffled by the wind. But something was strange. He took a moment to contemplate what was bothering him.</p>\n<p>Finally it dawned on him. There were no sounds. No chirping birds. No chattering squirrels. No babbling water.</p>\n<p>Curious. He was not used to squirrels disappearing at twilight. They were usually everywhere, and in abundance. One more nut to gather, one more chase to perform, one more scold to loudly chitter. He circled around, through a full 360° and more.</p>\n<p>Everything was quiet. Abnormally quiet. He grew very disquieted, his gut tightening. He stood still for a minute or two, timidly looking about.</p>\n<p>And he saw her.</p>\n<p>Ahead, over a slight rise and down the slope, on the side of the path, he saw a bench. A typical iron park bench, in an atypical location. Curlique arms and wooden slats. He had to stand straight, almost on tip-toes, to see it.</p>\n<p>Above the bench was a lamp post, ancient in appearance, with a globe dangling at the end of an arcing arm. A glow from within the globe cast a soft light onto the bench and the ground around.</p>\n<p>David stopped. He was ready to rub his eyes, cliché or no. The setting, the scene before his eyes, was as unexpected as it was familiar. Familiar like a scene from an evening stroll through a town square, or perhaps a vignette from at least a couple dozen old movies. Unexpected in that it was totally out of place in the middle of these wilds.</p>\n<p>Puzzled, and a bit wary, he slowly walked toward the bench. He realized he still had his hand on the top of his head. He quickly dropped it. He strode down the hill, following the path toward the bench. He carefully kept his eye on it.</p>\n<p>On the bench sat a small figure. The figure had a hand over its mouth. Whether this was an expression of minor horror or an attempt to suppress a giggle was not immediately clear.</p>\n<p>He stopped about three or four steps from the bench. The figure resolved itself to a woman, albeit somewhat amorphous within a burgundy fleece jacket and matching cap. She was petite. The portions of her appearance he could make out seemed attractive, but he could not immediately tell her age.</p>\n<p>“Hi,” she said brightly. “Looks like you ran into a little difficulty up there.”</p>\n<p>“Well, I did not expect an attack from the sky.”</p>\n<p>“Actually, it was from a tree. More precisely, from an oak. Not from the sky.” She pointed toward a big oak at the top of the slope.</p>\n<p>The point was obvious. But her remark did little to improve David’s mood. He was torn between a sulking and a sarcastic retort. After a moment of reflection he decided she was both accurate and amusing.</p>\n<p>He smiled and shrugged.</p>\n<p>“From a tree, then. I did not expect an attack from a tree. Nor did I expect a witness.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, I witnessed the attack of the acorn all right. I watched it leap from that tree and take deliberate aim for your head. Which it found, to your pain and embarrassment.”</p>\n<p>“The pain was obvious, I am sure. But why do you say embarrassment?”</p>\n<p>“You quickly looked around. You had an expression people often have when they are spied on under embarrassing circumstances.”</p>\n<p>“Were you spying, then? Following me?”</p>\n<p>“Spying? No. Following? Perhaps, although probably not in the way I think you mean.”</p>\n<p>He was now curious to see who he was talking to. He tilted his head and tried to see her face. He tried not be obvious, but of course he was. Her face was partly shaded by a small brim on her hat. Even so, the visible part looked vaguely familiar. Especially her eyes. The eyes looking up at him bore an expression of both amusement and familiarity.</p>\n<p>“And what way might that be?” His voice cracked with annoyance and apprehension. Something was unsettling in this encounter, but he didn’t yet understand what it was.</p>\n<p>“Stalking. Spying. Trailing. Maintaining unseen physical proximity. I do not mean following in any of those senses.”</p>\n<p>He just stared at her for a minute.</p>\n<p>“Do I know you?”</p>\n<p>He startled himself with the question. He had not planned to ask it. He really had not planned to engage in any conversation. That was why he sought these quiet woods. Rarely did they see more than a single visitor at any given time.</p>\n<p>But now it was too late. The question was out. The engagement was initiated.</p>\n<p>“That is an interesting question. I do not know how to answer it.”</p>\n<p>“You could start with yes or no. It is a simple honest question. Not a phoney pick-up line.&quot;</p>\n<p>He pointedly looked around. &ldquo;You seem kind of familiar, but I cannot really place you.”</p>\n<p>“Familiar like you have seen me in a queue at a café? Familiar like we once interacted? Maybe we talked?”</p>\n<p>He took a step and a half forward. He was close enough to touch the back of the bench, if he dared to reach out.</p>\n<p>“Like we have met. Like we have been together somewhere, sometime. But I cannot place it. I can feel it, but I cannot place it.”</p>\n<p>He hesitated. He looked closely at her, bending down slightly to do so. She shifted back almost imperceptibly, but continued looking straight at his eyes.</p>\n<p>Still uneasy, he asked, “Do you know me?”</p>\n<p>Her response was a simple smile. “You are David. Correct?”</p>\n<p>“Correct. And you are…?”</p>\n<p>“In due time. And we do have time.”</p>\n<p>He straightened, alerted by her response. He dared to break eye contact with her for a moment. He sensed that it might be dangerous to do so, but he was not sure why. He looked around carefully.</p>\n<p>The world outside the glow of the lamp had disappeared into darkness. A momentary panic set in, until he realized it was always darker when you looked out from inside a lighted area. Still, there would not be much light left when he tried to make his way out of the woods.</p>\n<p>Then he noted the continuing quiet. The wind rustling through the trees, the water in the river, the rustling of critters in the underbrush. All were disquietingly absent. It was strange how quiet the world had grown. He expected the sunset to take the light away, but not the sounds as well.</p>\n<p>She did not seem concerned. She was not alarmed about being lost in the woods in the dark. Perhaps she had a torchlight in her jacket. He might need to stay with her simply to get out of the woods in the dark. Especially if he did not leave soon.</p>\n<p>But he could not leave. Something drew him in. Kept him in the circle of light. Whoever she was, whatever she was doing here, he had to find out. When he set foot on the path he had no notion of meeting anyone or of doing anything other than allowing the solitude of the forest to dull the sense of oppression he felt.</p>\n<p>Now his original purpose no longer mattered. For some reason what now seemed to matter was to discover this woman’s identity and to figure out why -how- she knew him. It seemed that she did know him. At least she knew knew who he was. Which was almost the same thing, since he wasn’t a complicated person.</p>\n<p>What was their connection? He would try once more to find out.</p>\n<p>“Do you have a torchlight? It is getting dark, and we will have difficulty walking out of here once the last of the daylight is gone.”</p>\n<p>“I do not need one. I have my light.” She pointed to the globe over head.</p>\n<p>“That is rather large to carry.” His annoyance verged on sarcasm. She did not seem interested in providing direct meaningful answers to any of his questions.</p>\n<p>“It would be. But I do not need to carry it. I summon it when I need it.”</p>\n<p>“Do you have another light? A torchlight or lantern? Or do you live nearby?”</p>\n<p>“Not as close as you. My usual domicile is rather distant. I am here to see you.”</p>\n<p>“Okay, enough of that talk. Either you start with some useful information, or I am going, dark or not. I will stumble my way out if necessary, killer acorns be damned.”</p>\n<p>Her eyes looked deep into his. She smiled. Her face bore a very calming expression. Despite his agitation, her smile had a pacific effect on him.</p>\n<p>“I mean you no harm. Look at us. You are much bigger than I, and I have offered no threats or cause for fear. Please, sit down.”</p>\n<p>She indicated a space on the bench, and slid over a bit to emphasize her gesture. He did not move.</p>\n<p>“What do you want to know? What can I say to put you at ease?” Her voice was calm and her expression remained passive.</p>\n<p>“Who are you? What is your name? You know mine, apparently.”</p>\n<p>“Angie. My name is Angie. But you already know that.”</p>\n<p>She reached up. Her left arm reached across her forehead and she grasped her cap by the bill. With a quick sweep of her arm up and over her head the cap came off. After a quick shake of her head a mass of auburn curls burst out and surrounded her face.</p>\n<p>David blinked. He squinted at her in the semi-sideways manner he often employed when puzzling out something he saw. A flicker of recognition seemed to cross his face, but it quickly vanished and was replaced by puzzlement.</p>\n<p>“Angie. From where, from when, do you know me? Something is familiar, but there are pieces missing.”</p>\n<p>“We are not going to go there yet. We need to establish some basics first. Come. Sit here. I promise not to bite.”</p>\n<p>He hesitated, shifting his feet but not moving to take the proffered seat.</p>\n<p>“What kind of game is this?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She answered with a question. “Are you happy? You once asked me about happiness. Not ‘was I happy’. You asked ‘did I know happiness?’ So, now I ask you: Do you know happiness?&quot;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Who. Are. You?”</p>\n<p>“I am Angie. I told you. And you are David Pearl. A gem, but a flawed one. And currently an unhappy one. You cannot be happy that Christine is gone. Christine. Once your best hope for happiness. Or so you probably thought. I ask again: Do you have hope for happiness in your life? Do you know happiness?”</p>\n<p>“Christine put you up to this? That is it, right? Some macabre joke, some mind-game of hers. Well, you tell her I am on to it, and I am not going to give her the satisfaction!” His voice rose, with a nervous angry edge to its tone.</p>\n<p>He turned to leave. It was dark beyond the fringe of lamplight. He hoped he was facing the right direction. He did not want to make a dramatic exit, only to stumble off the pathway. He did not want Angie to report it back to Christine so they could have a big laugh at his buffoonery.</p>\n<p>As his eyes adjusted to the dimness of the woods, he saw a faint trace of lighter ground snaking off toward a slope. The trail. He took a step, another step. The pool of light was behind him, barely lighting his first steps.</p>\n<p>Suddenly everything turned dark. He stopped and glanced back. The light was gone. The clearing was black. Everything around him was black. The pathway at his feet was lost in the blackness of the dark woods.</p>\n<p>Startled, nervous, a bit scared, David turned back toward where he thought the clearing was.</p>\n<p>“Angie,” he croaked, his voice breaking. “What are you doing?”</p>\n<p>Nothing. No noise. Not even quiet breathing. He was alone. Alone and lost. Physically alone and lost. He suddenly began to feel emotionally alone and lost.</p>\n<p>Overwhelmed, feeling helpless and broken, he sank to his knees. He pressed his hands to his face and stifled a sob, turning it into a feeble gasp. He rocked on his knees, and moaned.</p>\n<p>A pain pierced his heart and, simultaneously, exploded in his head. A pain of loss, of conscience. She was right. He was alone again. He was back in his lonely solitude. All he was lacking at this moment was…</p>\n<p>“Angie! Come back! I need to talk to you.”</p>\n<p>The dark woods answered his cry with rustling leaves. He rose and took a step back in the direction of the bench.</p>\n<p>“Angie. Please.” An unbidden sob escaped him.</p>\n<p>A soft voice replied. It seemed to come from everywhere. “Please? Please what, David?”</p>\n<p>“Please explain. Why does she want to do this? Why do you?”</p>\n<p>“Hear me, David. First, there is no she in this. This is not about Christine. Not directly, at least.”</p>\n<p>Her voice still had no directionality. He turned his head from side to side, trying to find her.</p>\n<p>“Second, I do not want to do this. But I have to. I have to for you, and for me.”</p>\n<p>“Where are you? I do not like talking to the dark like this. Please show yourself. You are making me very nervous.” His voice cracked with anxiety. “Please.”</p>\n<p>He heard a gentle sound, like snapping fingers. Gradually, like a sunrise, the globe began casting its yellow-white glow from above. He saw the empty bench. A couple steps forward and he was in front of it. He pivoted, sat in the centre of the bench, and wrapped his arms around his body in a self-hug.</p>\n<p>“Where are you?”</p>\n<p>“Here.”</p>\n<p>He looked up, his eyes sweeping left to right. After a moment Angie seemed to glide into the field of light from the left.</p>\n<p>“Do you mind if I sit?” she asked.</p>\n<p>He slid to his right a bit and gestured to the open space on the bench. She settled on the bench, turning so she was facing him. She drew her right leg up and tucked it under her left thigh.</p>\n<p>After watching her for a few seconds, waiting for her to say something, he exhaled. “OK, where to start? You say this is not about Christine. For the sake of argument, I accept that. Then what is it about? Where do I, we, come into this picture?”</p>\n<p>Her big eyes absorbed him. He squirmed, and pulled his jacket closer. That was when he noticed that he was not feeling cold despite the night air settling in around them. In the bubble of light the night chill seemed to be absent. Just as the night sounds were. He sat silent for a couple of minutes. She sat and watched.</p>\n<p>“Remember Grade 12?”</p>\n<p>The question threw him off. Slowly at first, then with a rush, a burst of memory flashed into his mind.</p>\n<p>“No! I mean, yes, I do. Sort of.” He got excited. His face reflected his sudden awareness. “Now I remember you. You…are you that Angie?”</p>\n<p>“That is what I told you.”</p>\n<p>“But…but you cannot be. You cannot be that Angie. She was a geeky, gawky girl with big plastic glasses, braces on her teeth, and funny bangs. She was a girl who was nobody. Someone who… who had not blossomed.”</p>\n<p>“There is a difference between had not and would not. And I had blossomed enough to be a woman. Physically at least. As you may recall…”</p>\n<p>“Help me. I remember some of those days. But not all. I have worked to forget much of that part of my life.”</p>\n<p>She leaned over and slowly placed her hand on his knee. He felt the pressure of it for an instant, then the sensation disappeared. He looked at her, then down at his knee. Her hand still rested there. This whole encounter was strange, so he just accepted the loss of feeling.</p>\n<p>She began her story.</p>\n<p>“As you so eloquently put it, I was a geeky gawky girl. That did not mean I was not human. I felt things. Things like need. Physical need. Emotional need. Geeky I may have been. Correction. Geeky I was. Definitely geeky. Definitely in-between. But I still felt. Still hoped for attachment, for belonging. To mean something to someone.”</p>\n<p>“I am sure when we ‘accidentally’ met behind the school one afternoon, you were surprised. I think you could fairly say I was stalking you at that instant. I arranged that not-accidental meeting.”</p>\n<p>David’s eyes were wide, and she detected a bit of mistiness in them.</p>\n<p>“Why did you go to the trouble?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“Because you would not have paid any attention to me otherwise. You had not, despite my poor efforts to engage you. I am sure it would not have helped your reputation to be seen hanging around with geeky Angie. Even though you were mostly an outsider as well.”</p>\n<p>She hesitated. A couple of times she started to speak, then stopped.</p>\n<p>“Go on.” He encouraged her to continue.</p>\n<p>“And because we&hellip;we were supposed to be together. Not an adolescent crush kind of together. Forever together. A real rarity: true love. On one side, anyway.” She stopped and looked down. She looked up and her eyes grabbed his. “Love which has never died.”</p>\n<p>He swallowed. “I had no idea. Help me. Help me remember. Help me know more so I can figure out what this is about.”</p>\n<p>Angie nodded. She rubbed her right hand across her face before speaking. “We started talking. We walked into the woods. We walked for a while. Eventually, we came to…” She looked around.</p>\n<p>“Yes! I remember. We came to a clearing…” He slowly looked around, shaking his head.</p>\n<p>“Like this one. We sat against a tree.”</p>\n<p>“And I said it was okay if you wanted to touch me.”</p>\n<p>“You did. I remember. And I did. I touched you.” He looked down, brow furled with memories and recollections. “And we touched until we ended up naked together. We, I…I lost my virginity then.”</p>\n<p>Her smile twisted a bit. “So did I. Afterwards you asked me, when we were laying there together, ‘Did I know happiness?’ All I could say was ‘Yes’. Because at that moment, for the first time, I really knew happiness.”</p>\n<p>She turned fully towards him. Her eyes were filled with tears. She slowly shook her head as the memories flooded across her face. David was paralyzed; he did not know what to do; to say.</p>\n<p>He extended his index finger and gently touched the tip of her nose. Her nose twitched. Once. Twice. It was soft, warm, solid. Not spectral, not a delusion. She was made of warm flesh, just as he was.</p>\n<p>She inhaled deeply and continued.</p>\n<p>“But my newfound happiness did not last. The next day you avoided me. The next week. The next month. You shut me out. We made love once, then you shut me out. After a few months I left. Left school. Left town. Left everything.”</p>\n<p>He shook his head at her words. “Apparently I was a jerk. An idiot who was so afraid of knowing happiness that he threw it away. Threw away a chance without even giving it a second thought.”</p>\n<p>His eyes closed and his head tilted back. David brought his hands to his face and slowly rubbed it. He sat up and looked at her.</p>\n<p>“I am sorry. I am so sorry. I was shallow, callous. And I probably lost something of value. Look at you. You are astonishing. There is a… a glow about you. I have never seen such a glow on a woman. You are not only beautiful, but almost ethereal.”</p>\n<p>He shook his head and half-moaned. “What did I do? What have I done? Oh, what an idiot I have been.”</p>\n<p>She did not answer. Time passed. Slow, fast, he could not tell. They sat, silent and motionless. Acutely aware of her weightless hand still resting on his leg, he was afraid to move. Afraid to break whatever spell was being cast. He simply sat and stared into her face.</p>\n<p>After an indistinct bit of time passed, he exhaled loudly. He realized he had been holding his breath. He did not know how long he might have been holding it, or whether he had been breathing normally up to that moment. His awareness of time and place seemed to have been displaced.</p>\n<p>She looked up. Her eyes bored into his. Without a word, with barely a movement, she took her hand off his leg. His body shook, as a sudden chill ran through it.</p>\n<p>She unzipped her jacket and dropped it on the ground. She reached down, grabbed the hem of her dress, and pulled it off. She laid herself on the dress and drew him down.</p>\n<p>That moment in the woods flooded over him. He almost wept as she took him.</p>\n<p>And when she finally spoke, it was the barest whisper in his ear. “You destroyed us. You shut me out; ghosted me. You never knew the happiness we were destined for. And for what? Look at you now. Look at me. Feel me. Feel what you lost. Feel what you do not have; what you cannot have.”</p>\n<p>Everything grew even quieter. The quiet echoed off the hills and the light slowly faded.</p>\n<p>He woke with a shiver and a strong sense of confusion. Even before he opened his eyes he could smell the pungent autumn earth. The scent of decaying leaves and ripe acorns filled his nostrils, penetrating the fog in his head. Squirrels were loudly chattering. A jay was raucously screeching somewhere overhead.</p>\n<p>Disoriented, he opened his eyes. The sun was dappling the forest floor around him. He was face to face with a pile of leaves. He sat upright. The sudden movement made him dizzy. He closed his eyes and rested his forehead against his arm, waiting for the spell to pass.</p>\n<p>A boisterous squirrel chittered loudly just above him. Re-opening his eyes, slowly and carefully this time, he looked around. He was sitting at the bottom of a slope in a small forest clearing. Water was splashing over rocks somewhere nearby.</p>\n<p>He had been dreaming. He was sure of it. He was caught in the woods after dark, could not find his way out, and eventually fell asleep. When he realized this, some of the tension in his neck and shoulders began to ease. It was easy to confirm, no matter how vivid and present it felt. He turned around and looked. There was no bench. No light.</p>\n<p>It had been a dream after all. The most vivid, most stirring dream he could recall. He felt disappointed.</p>\n<p>Angie. She would be a reason for living. A way to know happiness. Too bad the previous night was not real. A ghost of a memory.</p>\n<p>He resolved to store the memory and its stirrings. Hang on to it, prevent it from becoming as ephemeral as his other dreams. Maybe try to find out what happened to Angie.</p>\n<p>He stood and stretched, then looked around for a path out to the wilds. Time to go home, pick up the pieces, move on.</p>\n<p>As he turned, he stumbled on something. He looked down. His nighttime-in-the-woods pillow was at his feet. He bent and picked it up. With amazement he looked at it, turning it over and over in his hands. He was holding a burgundy fleece jacket and a matching cap with a small bill. A long reddish hair was curled in the cap.</p>\n<p>Chasing an acorn along the path, kicking it ahead and following its bounces, he soon arrived back at the entry to the path. No one was around, but he did not feel alone.</p>\n<p>END</p>",
				"content_text": "Angie, again\n*a story*\n\nDavid Pearl sighed with relief. Travel was not his favourite way to spend his time, and he was ready to relax. He opened the door to the apartment, walked in, and pushed the door closed with his foot.\n\nHe called out but heard no response. Instead, he found a cold and echoing apartment. He dropped his travel bag in the hall and wandered through the rooms, wondering why it felt so strange. The answer came when he saw the open and newly emptied bedroom closet.\n\nOn the otherwise bare table he found a folded slip of paper, an abrupt goodbye comprised mainly of an accounting of the things Christine felt were within her rights to remove.\n\nAt least she had the grace not to recount his personal failings on paper. There was no need to; she had already performed an adequate job of doing that verbally. After hearing her repeated accounts of his deficits he began to wonder why she persisted in their relationship. These thoughts he kept to himself to avoid further inflaming the smouldering ashes of a once warming relationship.\n\nNow he had his answer. She no longer persisted.\n\nThe perfidy of it; of Christine. Go away for a few days and come back to find your life turned upside down. And you have no recourse, no voice in the sorry affair, and certainly no by-your-leave. It was a done deal. Such was the nature of betrayal, he thought bitterly.\n\nWith a sigh, David turned and left. No way he would be able to relax at home now; he needed space, and time, to deal with the ruins of his former life. And walking was his usual method of thinking through issues, of finding an often meandering path through the thickets of life.\n\nHe zipped his jacket against the light autumn breeze, and jammed his hands in his jeans pockets. Once he got moving he would warm up, but for the first few steps he hunched his shoulders and folded his body in on itself. It was not purely coincidence that his hunched body mirrored his mental scrunching. Without conscious effort he headed to the edge of town; to the refuge beyond. His respite; his gathering-thoughts place, where he could be alone within himself.\n\nAfter he passed between the stone pillars guarding the entry to the refuge David provided the only human activity to be seen. He shuffled through fallen leaves while his thoughts bounced between self-flagellation and self-righteous anger. He kicked at a small rock as he walked, chasing it across the path. It jumped and skipped around wildly, like the thoughts skittering across his mind.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nAn acorn dropped onto a red leaf near the edge of the path. The leaf popped into the air as if startled by the fallen nut. At the rise of the little red leaf, David hesitated. From the corner of his eye he saw its' startled movement. He realized he had been trudging along, head down, barely absorbing the sensory load of autumn. Unaware of the things around him. Just like Christine said.\n\nDavid’s refuge, a large wilds not far from town, was typically quiet and lonely. It did not draw many visitors; there were no real amenities, unless the presence of many trees counted as an amenity (which it should.) A meandering stream flowed under the trees and wound through the hills. Babbling water, chittering birds, and chattering squirrels broke the stillness of the wilds with their ever-present sounds.\n\nRoused by the motion of the red leaf, David raised his eyes and his turned his mind to the trees around him. Multi-hued leaves waved and fluttered in the crisp fall breeze, awaiting their turn to take the final plunge. Random patterns of light and shade dappling across the fluttering leaves created a natural kaleidoscope in all directions.\n\nHe stopped and looked skyward. He began spinning around in a dizzying arc. Remembering that autumn was his favourite season, and that he was wandering through the wilds on a beautiful autumn day, weather-wise at least, he gradually became alert to the nature surrounding him.\n\nAcross the slope of a hill he saw a glint of light scattering from the small pond. Low angle rays poking their way between hills and through tangled bare branches hit the surface of the water and bounced up to his eyes. Tracing the course of the rays from eyes to pond, and then upward through the trees, he was surprised at the low height of the sun. Could it really be nearing twilight already? He hesitated and looked about, turning through a full circle.\n\nThe pond, like the quiet walls winding across the hills around it, had an air of ancient solitude. Things had happened here in some era now long gone. Stones carefully piled to form meandering walls attested to that. It must have been a lot of hard dirty manual labor, hauling and piling stones, rocks, boulders. All to clear fields and form walls. All to no avail. The soil, cleared of surface stones, yielded only more stones from within its bowels year upon year. Eventually, the slopes and valleys were yielded to nature. Now, the only sign that the natural order had once been disturbed was piled stones.\n\nThe quietness of the autumn pond contrasted starkly with his memories of the clamour rising over it in the spring. Riotous spring, a gloriously fecund time of the year, seemed so long ago, so far away. Memories of spring contrasted starkly with the present autumn. David’s awareness returned to the current moment and his present life.\n\nHe wanted to go back. Back to where, he could not really say. Back to somewhere not here, now. As usual, back was not an option. Not when the proverbial time machine was in the proverbial time machine shop. And if he got his hands on a working time machine he was likely to enter the wrong data, the wrong coordinates, and end up as dinosaur dinner. So he went on instead.\n\nA breeze puffed into his jacket. He pulled it closer. Strands of hair blew across his forehead and tickled the bridge of his nose. Should have grabbed a cap before setting out on his little trek, he thought.\n\n‘Always full of acute hindsight,’ he added.\n\nTramping on through skittering leaves, he came to the top of a hill. Before him lay a small bowl-shaped valley, rimmed with colour and alive with flutters and dashes of blowing leaves. Suddenly, he felt a sharp rap on the top of his head. He took a small jump sideways and simultaneously reached up to the point of impact. The offending acorn continued its descent, its initial trajectory only slightly altered by the obstacle momentarily posed by his head.\n\nHe rubbed the bruised nob on his head. Almost automatically, David became self-conscious. Even though he was quite alone, a ridiculous notion, an autonomic response, seized his mind. Did anyone notice the indignity?\n\nRidiculous. There was no one around. And even if there was, so what? It would not matter.\n\nHe relaxed. He had not seen anyone since he reached the wilds and set foot in front of foot, trudging across leaves and gravel, rocks and roots, for a couple kilometres along the path.\n\nNevertheless, an awareness crept over him. He was not alone. He felt it. He felt it before he knew it. He stopped, his nerves tingling. Still rubbing the top of his head, he slowly turned around. He saw nothing. Nothing but trees, hills, leaves ruffled by the wind. But something was strange. He took a moment to contemplate what was bothering him.\n\nFinally it dawned on him. There were no sounds. No chirping birds. No chattering squirrels. No babbling water.\n\nCurious. He was not used to squirrels disappearing at twilight. They were usually everywhere, and in abundance. One more nut to gather, one more chase to perform, one more scold to loudly chitter. He circled around, through a full 360° and more.\n\nEverything was quiet. Abnormally quiet. He grew very disquieted, his gut tightening. He stood still for a minute or two, timidly looking about.\n\nAnd he saw her.\n\nAhead, over a slight rise and down the slope, on the side of the path, he saw a bench. A typical iron park bench, in an atypical location. Curlique arms and wooden slats. He had to stand straight, almost on tip-toes, to see it.\n\nAbove the bench was a lamp post, ancient in appearance, with a globe dangling at the end of an arcing arm. A glow from within the globe cast a soft light onto the bench and the ground around.\n\nDavid stopped. He was ready to rub his eyes, cliché or no. The setting, the scene before his eyes, was as unexpected as it was familiar. Familiar like a scene from an evening stroll through a town square, or perhaps a vignette from at least a couple dozen old movies. Unexpected in that it was totally out of place in the middle of these wilds.\n\nPuzzled, and a bit wary, he slowly walked toward the bench. He realized he still had his hand on the top of his head. He quickly dropped it. He strode down the hill, following the path toward the bench. He carefully kept his eye on it.\n\nOn the bench sat a small figure. The figure had a hand over its mouth. Whether this was an expression of minor horror or an attempt to suppress a giggle was not immediately clear.\n\nHe stopped about three or four steps from the bench. The figure resolved itself to a woman, albeit somewhat amorphous within a burgundy fleece jacket and matching cap. She was petite. The portions of her appearance he could make out seemed attractive, but he could not immediately tell her age.\n\n“Hi,” she said brightly. “Looks like you ran into a little difficulty up there.”\n\n“Well, I did not expect an attack from the sky.”\n\n“Actually, it was from a tree. More precisely, from an oak. Not from the sky.” She pointed toward a big oak at the top of the slope.\n\nThe point was obvious. But her remark did little to improve David’s mood. He was torn between a sulking and a sarcastic retort. After a moment of reflection he decided she was both accurate and amusing.\n\nHe smiled and shrugged.\n\n“From a tree, then. I did not expect an attack from a tree. Nor did I expect a witness.”\n\n“Oh, I witnessed the attack of the acorn all right. I watched it leap from that tree and take deliberate aim for your head. Which it found, to your pain and embarrassment.”\n\n“The pain was obvious, I am sure. But why do you say embarrassment?”\n\n“You quickly looked around. You had an expression people often have when they are spied on under embarrassing circumstances.”\n\n“Were you spying, then? Following me?”\n\n“Spying? No. Following? Perhaps, although probably not in the way I think you mean.”\n\nHe was now curious to see who he was talking to. He tilted his head and tried to see her face. He tried not be obvious, but of course he was. Her face was partly shaded by a small brim on her hat. Even so, the visible part looked vaguely familiar. Especially her eyes. The eyes looking up at him bore an expression of both amusement and familiarity.\n\n“And what way might that be?” His voice cracked with annoyance and apprehension. Something was unsettling in this encounter, but he didn’t yet understand what it was.\n\n“Stalking. Spying. Trailing. Maintaining unseen physical proximity. I do not mean following in any of those senses.”\n\nHe just stared at her for a minute.\n\n“Do I know you?”\n\nHe startled himself with the question. He had not planned to ask it. He really had not planned to engage in any conversation. That was why he sought these quiet woods. Rarely did they see more than a single visitor at any given time.\n\nBut now it was too late. The question was out. The engagement was initiated.\n\n“That is an interesting question. I do not know how to answer it.”\n\n“You could start with yes or no. It is a simple honest question. Not a phoney pick-up line.\"\n\nHe pointedly looked around. \"You seem kind of familiar, but I cannot really place you.”\n\n“Familiar like you have seen me in a queue at a café? Familiar like we once interacted? Maybe we talked?”\n\nHe took a step and a half forward. He was close enough to touch the back of the bench, if he dared to reach out.\n\n“Like we have met. Like we have been together somewhere, sometime. But I cannot place it. I can feel it, but I cannot place it.”\n\nHe hesitated. He looked closely at her, bending down slightly to do so. She shifted back almost imperceptibly, but continued looking straight at his eyes.\n\nStill uneasy, he asked, “Do you know me?”\n\nHer response was a simple smile. “You are David. Correct?”\n\n“Correct. And you are…?”\n\n“In due time. And we do have time.”\n\nHe straightened, alerted by her response. He dared to break eye contact with her for a moment. He sensed that it might be dangerous to do so, but he was not sure why. He looked around carefully.\n\nThe world outside the glow of the lamp had disappeared into darkness. A momentary panic set in, until he realized it was always darker when you looked out from inside a lighted area. Still, there would not be much light left when he tried to make his way out of the woods.\n\nThen he noted the continuing quiet. The wind rustling through the trees, the water in the river, the rustling of critters in the underbrush. All were disquietingly absent. It was strange how quiet the world had grown. He expected the sunset to take the light away, but not the sounds as well.\n\nShe did not seem concerned. She was not alarmed about being lost in the woods in the dark. Perhaps she had a torchlight in her jacket. He might need to stay with her simply to get out of the woods in the dark. Especially if he did not leave soon.\n\nBut he could not leave. Something drew him in. Kept him in the circle of light. Whoever she was, whatever she was doing here, he had to find out. When he set foot on the path he had no notion of meeting anyone or of doing anything other than allowing the solitude of the forest to dull the sense of oppression he felt.\n\nNow his original purpose no longer mattered. For some reason what now seemed to matter was to discover this woman’s identity and to figure out why -how- she knew him. It seemed that she did know him. At least she knew knew who he was. Which was almost the same thing, since he wasn’t a complicated person.\n\nWhat was their connection? He would try once more to find out.\n\n“Do you have a torchlight? It is getting dark, and we will have difficulty walking out of here once the last of the daylight is gone.”\n\n“I do not need one. I have my light.” She pointed to the globe over head.\n\n“That is rather large to carry.” His annoyance verged on sarcasm. She did not seem interested in providing direct meaningful answers to any of his questions.\n\n“It would be. But I do not need to carry it. I summon it when I need it.”\n\n“Do you have another light? A torchlight or lantern? Or do you live nearby?”\n\n“Not as close as you. My usual domicile is rather distant. I am here to see you.”\n\n“Okay, enough of that talk. Either you start with some useful information, or I am going, dark or not. I will stumble my way out if necessary, killer acorns be damned.”\n\nHer eyes looked deep into his. She smiled. Her face bore a very calming expression. Despite his agitation, her smile had a pacific effect on him.\n\n“I mean you no harm. Look at us. You are much bigger than I, and I have offered no threats or cause for fear. Please, sit down.”\n\nShe indicated a space on the bench, and slid over a bit to emphasize her gesture. He did not move.\n\n“What do you want to know? What can I say to put you at ease?” Her voice was calm and her expression remained passive.\n\n“Who are you? What is your name? You know mine, apparently.”\n\n“Angie. My name is Angie. But you already know that.”\n\nShe reached up. Her left arm reached across her forehead and she grasped her cap by the bill. With a quick sweep of her arm up and over her head the cap came off. After a quick shake of her head a mass of auburn curls burst out and surrounded her face.\n\nDavid blinked. He squinted at her in the semi-sideways manner he often employed when puzzling out something he saw. A flicker of recognition seemed to cross his face, but it quickly vanished and was replaced by puzzlement.\n\n“Angie. From where, from when, do you know me? Something is familiar, but there are pieces missing.”\n\n“We are not going to go there yet. We need to establish some basics first. Come. Sit here. I promise not to bite.”\n\nHe hesitated, shifting his feet but not moving to take the proffered seat.\n\n“What kind of game is this?\"\n\nShe answered with a question. “Are you happy? You once asked me about happiness. Not ‘was I happy’. You asked ‘did I know happiness?’ So, now I ask you: Do you know happiness?\"\n\n\"Who. Are. You?”\n\n“I am Angie. I told you. And you are David Pearl. A gem, but a flawed one. And currently an unhappy one. You cannot be happy that Christine is gone. Christine. Once your best hope for happiness. Or so you probably thought. I ask again: Do you have hope for happiness in your life? Do you know happiness?”\n\n“Christine put you up to this? That is it, right? Some macabre joke, some mind-game of hers. Well, you tell her I am on to it, and I am not going to give her the satisfaction!” His voice rose, with a nervous angry edge to its tone.\n\nHe turned to leave. It was dark beyond the fringe of lamplight. He hoped he was facing the right direction. He did not want to make a dramatic exit, only to stumble off the pathway. He did not want Angie to report it back to Christine so they could have a big laugh at his buffoonery.\n\nAs his eyes adjusted to the dimness of the woods, he saw a faint trace of lighter ground snaking off toward a slope. The trail. He took a step, another step. The pool of light was behind him, barely lighting his first steps.\n\nSuddenly everything turned dark. He stopped and glanced back. The light was gone. The clearing was black. Everything around him was black. The pathway at his feet was lost in the blackness of the dark woods.\n\nStartled, nervous, a bit scared, David turned back toward where he thought the clearing was.\n\n“Angie,” he croaked, his voice breaking. “What are you doing?”\n\nNothing. No noise. Not even quiet breathing. He was alone. Alone and lost. Physically alone and lost. He suddenly began to feel emotionally alone and lost.\n\nOverwhelmed, feeling helpless and broken, he sank to his knees. He pressed his hands to his face and stifled a sob, turning it into a feeble gasp. He rocked on his knees, and moaned.\n\nA pain pierced his heart and, simultaneously, exploded in his head. A pain of loss, of conscience. She was right. He was alone again. He was back in his lonely solitude. All he was lacking at this moment was…\n\n“Angie! Come back! I need to talk to you.”\n\nThe dark woods answered his cry with rustling leaves. He rose and took a step back in the direction of the bench.\n\n“Angie. Please.” An unbidden sob escaped him.\n\nA soft voice replied. It seemed to come from everywhere. “Please? Please what, David?”\n\n“Please explain. Why does she want to do this? Why do you?”\n\n“Hear me, David. First, there is no she in this. This is not about Christine. Not directly, at least.”\n\nHer voice still had no directionality. He turned his head from side to side, trying to find her.\n\n“Second, I do not want to do this. But I have to. I have to for you, and for me.”\n\n“Where are you? I do not like talking to the dark like this. Please show yourself. You are making me very nervous.” His voice cracked with anxiety. “Please.”\n\nHe heard a gentle sound, like snapping fingers. Gradually, like a sunrise, the globe began casting its yellow-white glow from above. He saw the empty bench. A couple steps forward and he was in front of it. He pivoted, sat in the centre of the bench, and wrapped his arms around his body in a self-hug.\n\n“Where are you?”\n\n“Here.”\n\nHe looked up, his eyes sweeping left to right. After a moment Angie seemed to glide into the field of light from the left.\n\n“Do you mind if I sit?” she asked.\n\nHe slid to his right a bit and gestured to the open space on the bench. She settled on the bench, turning so she was facing him. She drew her right leg up and tucked it under her left thigh.\n\nAfter watching her for a few seconds, waiting for her to say something, he exhaled. “OK, where to start? You say this is not about Christine. For the sake of argument, I accept that. Then what is it about? Where do I, we, come into this picture?”\n\nHer big eyes absorbed him. He squirmed, and pulled his jacket closer. That was when he noticed that he was not feeling cold despite the night air settling in around them. In the bubble of light the night chill seemed to be absent. Just as the night sounds were. He sat silent for a couple of minutes. She sat and watched.\n\n“Remember Grade 12?”\n\nThe question threw him off. Slowly at first, then with a rush, a burst of memory flashed into his mind.\n\n“No! I mean, yes, I do. Sort of.” He got excited. His face reflected his sudden awareness. “Now I remember you. You…are you that Angie?”\n\n“That is what I told you.”\n\n“But…but you cannot be. You cannot be that Angie. She was a geeky, gawky girl with big plastic glasses, braces on her teeth, and funny bangs. She was a girl who was nobody. Someone who… who had not blossomed.”\n\n“There is a difference between had not and would not. And I had blossomed enough to be a woman. Physically at least. As you may recall…”\n\n“Help me. I remember some of those days. But not all. I have worked to forget much of that part of my life.”\n\nShe leaned over and slowly placed her hand on his knee. He felt the pressure of it for an instant, then the sensation disappeared. He looked at her, then down at his knee. Her hand still rested there. This whole encounter was strange, so he just accepted the loss of feeling.\n\nShe began her story.\n\n“As you so eloquently put it, I was a geeky gawky girl. That did not mean I was not human. I felt things. Things like need. Physical need. Emotional need. Geeky I may have been. Correction. Geeky I was. Definitely geeky. Definitely in-between. But I still felt. Still hoped for attachment, for belonging. To mean something to someone.”\n\n“I am sure when we ‘accidentally’ met behind the school one afternoon, you were surprised. I think you could fairly say I was stalking you at that instant. I arranged that not-accidental meeting.”\n\nDavid’s eyes were wide, and she detected a bit of mistiness in them.\n\n“Why did you go to the trouble?” he asked.\n\n“Because you would not have paid any attention to me otherwise. You had not, despite my poor efforts to engage you. I am sure it would not have helped your reputation to be seen hanging around with geeky Angie. Even though you were mostly an outsider as well.”\n\nShe hesitated. A couple of times she started to speak, then stopped.\n\n“Go on.” He encouraged her to continue.\n\n“And because we...we were supposed to be together. Not an adolescent crush kind of together. Forever together. A real rarity: true love. On one side, anyway.” She stopped and looked down. She looked up and her eyes grabbed his. “Love which has never died.”\n\nHe swallowed. “I had no idea. Help me. Help me remember. Help me know more so I can figure out what this is about.”\n\nAngie nodded. She rubbed her right hand across her face before speaking. “We started talking. We walked into the woods. We walked for a while. Eventually, we came to…” She looked around.\n\n“Yes! I remember. We came to a clearing…” He slowly looked around, shaking his head.\n\n“Like this one. We sat against a tree.”\n\n“And I said it was okay if you wanted to touch me.”\n\n“You did. I remember. And I did. I touched you.” He looked down, brow furled with memories and recollections. “And we touched until we ended up naked together. We, I…I lost my virginity then.”\n\nHer smile twisted a bit. “So did I. Afterwards you asked me, when we were laying there together, ‘Did I know happiness?’ All I could say was ‘Yes’. Because at that moment, for the first time, I really knew happiness.”\n\nShe turned fully towards him. Her eyes were filled with tears. She slowly shook her head as the memories flooded across her face. David was paralyzed; he did not know what to do; to say.\n\nHe extended his index finger and gently touched the tip of her nose. Her nose twitched. Once. Twice. It was soft, warm, solid. Not spectral, not a delusion. She was made of warm flesh, just as he was.\n\nShe inhaled deeply and continued.\n\n“But my newfound happiness did not last. The next day you avoided me. The next week. The next month. You shut me out. We made love once, then you shut me out. After a few months I left. Left school. Left town. Left everything.”\n\nHe shook his head at her words. “Apparently I was a jerk. An idiot who was so afraid of knowing happiness that he threw it away. Threw away a chance without even giving it a second thought.”\n\nHis eyes closed and his head tilted back. David brought his hands to his face and slowly rubbed it. He sat up and looked at her.\n\n“I am sorry. I am so sorry. I was shallow, callous. And I probably lost something of value. Look at you. You are astonishing. There is a… a glow about you. I have never seen such a glow on a woman. You are not only beautiful, but almost ethereal.”\n\nHe shook his head and half-moaned. “What did I do? What have I done? Oh, what an idiot I have been.”\n\nShe did not answer. Time passed. Slow, fast, he could not tell. They sat, silent and motionless. Acutely aware of her weightless hand still resting on his leg, he was afraid to move. Afraid to break whatever spell was being cast. He simply sat and stared into her face.\n\nAfter an indistinct bit of time passed, he exhaled loudly. He realized he had been holding his breath. He did not know how long he might have been holding it, or whether he had been breathing normally up to that moment. His awareness of time and place seemed to have been displaced.\n\nShe looked up. Her eyes bored into his. Without a word, with barely a movement, she took her hand off his leg. His body shook, as a sudden chill ran through it.\n\nShe unzipped her jacket and dropped it on the ground. She reached down, grabbed the hem of her dress, and pulled it off. She laid herself on the dress and drew him down.\n\nThat moment in the woods flooded over him. He almost wept as she took him.\n\nAnd when she finally spoke, it was the barest whisper in his ear. “You destroyed us. You shut me out; ghosted me. You never knew the happiness we were destined for. And for what? Look at you now. Look at me. Feel me. Feel what you lost. Feel what you do not have; what you cannot have.”\n\nEverything grew even quieter. The quiet echoed off the hills and the light slowly faded.\n\nHe woke with a shiver and a strong sense of confusion. Even before he opened his eyes he could smell the pungent autumn earth. The scent of decaying leaves and ripe acorns filled his nostrils, penetrating the fog in his head. Squirrels were loudly chattering. A jay was raucously screeching somewhere overhead.\n\nDisoriented, he opened his eyes. The sun was dappling the forest floor around him. He was face to face with a pile of leaves. He sat upright. The sudden movement made him dizzy. He closed his eyes and rested his forehead against his arm, waiting for the spell to pass.\n\nA boisterous squirrel chittered loudly just above him. Re-opening his eyes, slowly and carefully this time, he looked around. He was sitting at the bottom of a slope in a small forest clearing. Water was splashing over rocks somewhere nearby.\n\nHe had been dreaming. He was sure of it. He was caught in the woods after dark, could not find his way out, and eventually fell asleep. When he realized this, some of the tension in his neck and shoulders began to ease. It was easy to confirm, no matter how vivid and present it felt. He turned around and looked. There was no bench. No light.\n\nIt had been a dream after all. The most vivid, most stirring dream he could recall. He felt disappointed.\n\nAngie. She would be a reason for living. A way to know happiness. Too bad the previous night was not real. A ghost of a memory.\n\nHe resolved to store the memory and its stirrings. Hang on to it, prevent it from becoming as ephemeral as his other dreams. Maybe try to find out what happened to Angie.\n\nHe stood and stretched, then looked around for a path out to the wilds. Time to go home, pick up the pieces, move on.\n\nAs he turned, he stumbled on something. He looked down. His nighttime-in-the-woods pillow was at his feet. He bent and picked it up. With amazement he looked at it, turning it over and over in his hands. He was holding a burgundy fleece jacket and a matching cap with a small bill. A long reddish hair was curled in the cap.\n\nChasing an acorn along the path, kicking it ahead and following its bounces, he soon arrived back at the entry to the path. No one was around, but he did not feel alone.\n\nEND\n",

				"title": "The Downfall of a Leaf",
				"content_html": "<p><em>a story</em></p>\n<p>The old man glared up at one last leaf clinging to an otherwise bare maple tree. That annoying remaining leaf was swaying in the autumn breeze, seemingly oblivious to the lateness of the season.</p>\n<p>“Waste of time, gathering up all the fallen leaves. Let them rot where they fall. That is what I should be doing. Mother knows how to take care of her own leavings. Nothing wasted with her. Ashes to ashes, leaves to dirt,“ he grumbled.</p>\n<p>Jim did not see the sense in spending good energy messing with nature&rsquo;s job. The leaves would soon enough be gone on their own. All he had to do was ignore them until the snow covered them. Come spring, they would be mostly decayed and gone. There were better things to do than chase dry old leaves blowing around the yard, especially since as soon as he went back inside that last damned leaf would decide it was time to fall.</p>\n<p>Damn that old Maggie Miller! If not for her and her persnickety ways he would not be out in the chilly autumn air, bothering about a few dead leaves. If she was not so darn snooty about how neat and clean she kept her place, constantly telling him he ought to follow her good example so his leaves did not blow over to her yard, he would have things a lot easier. As if he controlled which way the wind blew. As if she could tell which leaves were from which tree.</p>\n<p>As if he cared two bits about her near-constant stream of comments on his life and habits.</p>\n<p>That darn old woman had a way of going on and on that was too darn close to being just like an old nagging wife. She should just let a man live in peace in whatever way he preferred.</p>\n<p>He ought to stop listening to her. And one day -soon!- he would. Just you wait and see. More than twice Jim had sworn a binding resolution to himself, often right around about the point he could see the bottom of his whiskey glass, to resist her malign influence and run his own durn life in his own durn way and durn her if she did not durn well like it.</p>\n<p>Jim stepped back a couple metres and glared up at the offending leaf. Maybe if he held the rake so it reached straight up over his head and made a bit of a jump upward he might snag that last stupid leaf. He would save himself another wasteful trip back outside when the dad-blamed thing finally decided to let loose and drop.</p>\n<p>He stepped back and circled around under the fluttering spot of colour. Eyeing the angle, triangulating the distance and height, he tried to calibrate where to aim his rake. He was not real sure he could manage a second jump. He better get everything aligned just right for his one shot.</p>\n<p>He grasped the rake handle near the butt end and slowly raised it high up above his head. He leaned back a bit to confirm his triangulation, but a spot of sun glare flashed into his eye. He brought his left hand up to shade his eyes and he leaned back a bit.</p>\n<p>Just as he prepared to launch himself and the rake at the leaf he heard the screen slam on Margaret&rsquo;s back porch. She had been poking her nose out from behind a frilly curtain all along. Of that he could be sure.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;James Joseph Johnson, you old fool! What in name of all that is sensible are you planning to do there?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He tried to ignore her but she threw him off. He twisted slightly when he jumped, more like a hop, and his lean took him corkscrewing over backwards. He began an unplanned and uncontrolled descent to the leaf-free ground.</p>\n<p>The rake followed him down on its own path of descent. The butt end of the rake’s handle landed smack dab in the middle of his forehead just as his head hit the ground. The rake tried to balance on his face, like a wobbling bowling pin. After a moment it apparently decided this was an untenable position. The rake clattered to the ground, its handle falling across his face and its tines dancing on the earth.</p>\n<p>The rake handle shimmied and danced in counter-time to the flexing tines. The handle repeatedly bounced against his face while he lay on his back on the cold ground. His left leg twisted farther to the left than it should have and the back of his head was smashed against the ground by the repeated blows of the rake handle.</p>\n<p>Everything went dark. When Jim again saw the light he felt the warm stickiness of blood oozing out of his nose. He closed his eyes. That felt better.</p>\n<p>After an undefined bit of time, he felt his head being lifted from the ground. It was a strange feeling. His head seemed to be moving without any effort on his part. It was like some sort of out-of-body thing. Maybe he was dead.</p>\n<p>He decided to tempt fate and discover if it was true that he just died. He carefully opened one eye. He immediately saw a familiar face just inches from his own.</p>\n<p>Margaret was leaning over him. She was lifted his spinning head off the grass and onto her generous thighs. Jim almost felt disappointed that he was not doing that out-of-body thing.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Stupid crazy fool,” she muttered. He knew he was meant to hear her imprecations.</p>\n<p>He could not figure how she managed to get there so quickly. Margaret generally moseyed along at a slow and deliberate pace, calibrated to the nearest turtle.</p>\n<p>The puzzle of Margaret’s newfound speed was quickly chased away by a strange sensation on his left side. He tried to straighten his body. He grimaced as a sharp pain scorched its way from his leg up to his woozy head.</p>\n<p>Margaret saw his expression. She looked down at his leg and saw its peculiar position. She gasped. Margaret almost dropped his head right back onto the dirt. She regained her composure and carefully lowered his head to the ground.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I will be right back. You need an ambulance, and a cold pack for your nose. You better not bother trying to get up and go anywhere before I get back.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Just like a woman, he thought. Talking nonsense just to show who is in charge. Why bother, when there ain&rsquo;t been a man alive in 2000 years who could have felt he was in charge, or even had a real say, with anything that involved a woman.</p>\n<p>How he was supposed to go somewhere with a busted leg he could not guess. What, did she think he was going to go join a line dance at the Legion or something?</p>\n<p>His head spun. Before things went black again his eyes caught a flash of reddish-orange over his head. That stubborn leaf fluttered on its branch, mocking him as a bit of autumn wind gusted by.</p>\n<p>Inside, at a window in Jim’s upstairs back bedroom a small black feline adjusted her hind end, wiggling it to the right and then to the left as if to properly fold her skirts before settling down. It was her usual time to supervise the birds at the feeders.</p>\n<p>The furkin watched the bit of drama unfolding down below. Any action that relieved the tedium of her day was interesting, so she paid close attention. She saw two humans, one of them hers and the other one the noisy one that came around all the time, being a general botheration. The humans seemed to be engaged in one of the strange antics to which humans were inclined.</p>\n<p>With the feigned indifference that is the mark of a cat paying keen attention, she carefully studied the situation. What really went on in their heads, if anything, when they performed some of their inexplicable actions? Realizing that the answer to this puzzle was probably unattainable, she put it aside and turned her attention to more engaging pursuits.</p>\n<p>A flutter of colour in the tree grabbed her attention. She quickly realized it was not a flashy little bird she should do something about.</p>\n<p>She turned back to watching the flurry of activity in the yard. Some new people rushed into the yard. They started gathering around her human but all he did was lay there. Crazy human- he was not even in a sunny spot. Humans sure did not know about the best places. She often saw them sitting in shady places instead of taking advantage of the warmth of a circle of sun.</p>\n<p>She watched them put her human on a table with wheels and roll it out of the yard. She jumped down from the window and ran to the front of the house. She climbed onto the back of the sofa and watched the people put the table with her person into a truck. She watched the truck sped away. Her human had filled her water and set out a dish of food for her before he went out to play in the yard, so she was not overly concerned about him going away.</p>\n<p>Her concern grew, however, when dark came and then the sun came again. Now her food dish was empty. Despite her constant attention whenever she heard the opener, she had not figured out how to open the cans for herself.</p>\n<p>Oh, well. She knew where a bag of dry food was kept and she knew how to open the pantry door to get to it. Knocking it over was no longer a great feat; she had mastered that years ago. As long as there was dry food in the pantry she would not go hungry. She decided to find a spot of sun and take a nap while she waited for her human to show up. He always did. But he never before went away without setting out an extra dish of food. Something was different this time.</p>\n<p>Her day was long but uneventful. She had to move four times to find new sunny patches, and she spent an hour exploring the back of a closet. Dark arrived again, and her human had not returned.</p>\n<p>She jumped to the sink in the bathroom and batted at the lever until water came out. Her person had never figured out why that tap dripped. One time she watched him attack it with some metal things. He yelled at it when he found water leaking from it a few days later. Humans were funny creatures.</p>\n<p>Daring to wet her face, she caught a few drops of fresh water as they dripped into the sink. Next, she set out to get food. It was dim in the pantry but she knew exactly where to look for the bag. Fortunately, it was open. When she tipped it some crunchies spilled out. Satisfied that she could provide for herself, she ate a few before heading for the big bed and a well-deserved rest.</p>\n<p>The sun was high over the tree with its flashy leaf when she heard noises at the front of the house. She sat up and waited, listening carefully. “Now Margaret. You jus’ go on to home. I will do fine and dandy here in my very own house.”</p>\n<p>“Jim, you just got out of the hospital. You ought not to be running around without someone to look after you. Leastwise not ’til you get settled.”</p>\n<p>“I can look after me just fine. I got these crutches to help me get about and I got a cane in the closet. I do not need your looking after me.”</p>\n<p>“Well, I do not feel right about just running off and leaving you alone. Look at you! You are a sight to see, what with a broken leg and a taped-up nose. Sinatra was not talking about your kind of Blue Eyes, either. He never crooned Black and Blue Eyes.”</p>\n<p>The cat softly jumped to the floor and sneaked out to the front room. As soon as she saw her human she meowed once and walked over to him. This did not seem like a suitable time to punish him by ignoring him. She began rubbing against his leg. She stopped when she saw that the other leg was wrapped in a hard shell. She looked up at him, then at the other human. It was the noisy one who made her human grumpy whenever she came around.</p>\n<p>“You see? I ain’t alone. I got my cat to keep me company. The very cat you pushed in my door and insisted I keep. She kept me in good company for a while now. I reckon she will do so tonight.”</p>\n<p>“It may well be that she is good company, but she sure does not know how to fix you a good meal. And that is what I am going to do right now. You heard the doctor. You need to eat well and rest up so your leg can mend. You said you do not want to go to any care centre, so you have got to accept the proper care in your own house.”</p>\n<p>“Alright Margaret. I know the only way to get you out of here is to let you have a bit of your own way. But after I have a bite I am gonna lay down for a rest on my bed, and you are gonna be gone when I get up. That is the way it has to be. That is the only way I will tolerate your bothering me.”</p>\n<p>He reached down to scoop up the little cat and stumbled forward. Margaret rushed over to steady him, but he waved her away.</p>\n<p>“Leave me alone. Stop your fussing over me. I am fine. Just need to re-establish my balances.”</p>\n<p>He managed to gather the cat in his arm. He balanced himself carefully while he rubbed her head. She turned on her purr motor and pushed against his hand, urging it to keep going and nudging it to the right spots.</p>\n<p>Turning back to Margaret, he snarled. “Well, go on. Go make your mess in the kitchen so you can finish your meddling and get on out and leave us in peace.”</p>\n<p>She backed off at his rising annoyance, and went into the kitchen after emitting a last note of hmmph. “Stubborn foolish ornery old man,” she muttered. “Going to need some extra looking after. Going to need me, he will soon see. Not going to be able to do much but sit around for some time to come.”</p>\n<p>Jim barely had time to hobble to his worn armchair and drop his skinny body onto it before Margaret’s cry rang out from the kitchen. It echoed around the corner and burst against his ears.</p>\n<p>“Lordy, Jim. You got quite some mess in here. How long since this place got top to bottom attention? I tell you, it is going to take me some time to get this place just to the point where I can begin to fix a proper meal.”</p>\n<p>In a non-subtle stage whisper she continued. “I do not get how anyone can go on living like this day in and day out. Not right; not good. It is just pride going before the fall.”</p>\n<p>Realizing her unintended pun, she chuckled and repeated it. “Pride before the fall. And now too much pride after the fall.”</p>\n<p>Unable to resist any longer, he called back, “I can hear you, you know. My ears ain’t busted. And I got good reason to have my pride.”</p>\n<p>After a pause, he could not resist a final dig, “As you full well know.”</p>\n<p>She stood in the doorway between the two rooms, wiping her hands on a ratty grey towel. “Forty-eight years. That is a powerful lot of stubborn pride to be harbouring. You have a long long way to fall, holding on to all that pride for all that time.”</p>\n<p>“You know it was not me who ran off with some other fella while her man was away. It ain’t pride, knowing you have been done wrong to. It ain’t pride when you are out there in the mud and snow in a faraway land and you hear about your sweetheart, the one whose letters you kept right next to your heart each night, snugging up to some other fella. No sir. It was not me who ran off. So if you are gonna go and get uppity on me you best just run along right now.”</p>\n<p>Margaret put her fists on her broad hips and shook her head at him. “It is a wonder that woman you married put up with your griping and moaning for all of those years. It drove her to her early grave. I am sure of that.”</p>\n<p>“It is a wonder she came out of the same line as you, seeing as she was kind and considerate. How did she come to be your cousin anyhow? It would be like a skunk and a bluebird can be cousins. And you were not the bluebird.”</p>\n<p>“You do not need to be hollering at me, Jim. I am not trying to get you riled, telling you what you ought or ought not to be doing. I am not deserving of these hard words and you know it. Lordy, all I know is I am here trying to help you, same as usual, and you are busting all over me for it. I do not know, Jim. I ought to just give up, like you say. Let you go off and perform whatever acts of craziness you prefer and hang the consequences.”</p>\n<p>“Acts of craziness? Like hanging by you for so long? We have known each other more than half a century now. If I am so all fired crazy, why the good heck are you still here?”</p>\n<p>Margaret sighed. She dropped the towel on the sideboard and quietly walked across to his chair. She half perched on the arm of the chair and placed her hand on his arm. She started stroking her fingers across it, as if to straighten out the wayward hairs poking out at odd angles. “Oh, Jim, Jim, Jim. It is not so much that you are crazy. It is just that sometimes you get crazy notions and I get scared for you.”</p>\n<p>“Well, stop. Somehow I have managed to reach this day just fine. This day is about 78 years past my entry to this here world. Somehow, my crazy notions have not killed me yet. Maybe someday they will, but at least I will go on my terms. That is the way I want it-on my terms. Just like you want it on yours.” He shook her hand off his arm in a gesture of defiance.</p>\n<p>“Well, your way did some pretty damage this time. And if I was not here to pick up your pieces, you would be stuck in a care centre right now.”</p>\n<p>“Maybe if you were not here I would not ‘ve broke my leg. Maybe I would not have bothered about the durn leaves, since I do not mind them nearly as much as you do. How about that for a thought?” He looked off across the yard, avoiding her eyes. He did not bother about her hand this time, though.</p>\n<p>“Look, Jim. How many times do I have to tell you that you are not so young any more. It is long past time you gave up thinking you can just go and do whatever bit of foolishness comes to your fool head.”</p>\n<p>“None, Margaret. You never need to tell me anything. You always seem to want to, but you never have to. You have been pestering me for years and years, and I have been trying to not hear you for about the same years. Let it rest, Margaret. Let me finish out my life in peace. If I need you sometime, you might hear it from me. Otherwise, stop scuffing at my doorstep every day now.”</p>\n<p>“You cannot do that.”</p>\n<p>“I cannot do what, Margaret?”</p>\n<p>“You cannot tell me to get out and stay out. You need someone to look after you, to help you out until you get back up on your feet. And that someone has got to be me, since I know you best.”</p>\n<p>He glared at her from his seat. “I told you I do not need no one to be fussing around me, trying to run my life. Least of all you. I will take care of my own self in my own way. Why not just go bother the leaves in your yard or something and leave me be now.”</p>\n<p>She harrumphed.</p>\n<p>The cat jumped but Jim did not even look up when the door slammed. The sun rose bright and strong the next morning. It took Jim a while to clear out the sink and restore the dishes to their rightful spots. He burned a couple slices of toast and cooked up some coffee. After his breakfast he practiced perambulating up and down the kitchen, getting a solid feel for his new three point stance. Once he was satisfied with his progress, he thump-shuffle-thumped to the front door and picked up the paper. He shuffled back to the kitchen table and eased his way onto a seat.</p>\n<p>After a while he became aware that he was not alone. He glanced over the top of his paper and saw the cat perched on the table. She was surveying the yard. Her wiggling rear meant there was something of interest out there. He squirmed around in his chair and looked out at the barren garden. He saw patches of dirt where a mole broke through the dry brown grass, and the thorny rosebushes along the back fence. Eventually, his eyes came to rest on the miscreant tree.</p>\n<p>He saw the lone leaf still clinging to the otherwise barren tree. It fluttered in the breeze but showed no inclination to give up its high perch. He gripped the edge of the table until his knuckles went white.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Bastard leaf,&rdquo; Jim mumbled. “Maybe I ought to just cut down your whole damn tree. That might show you who has got the last say.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He eyed the cat perched on the table. &ldquo;You know you are not supposed to be up there. Skee-daddle down now, you hear?”</p>\n<p>She looked at him to gauge his level of seriousness. When he did not bother to push her off the table she settled her chest fur with a couple of quick licks and turned back to the window. She began to purr lightly.</p>\n<p>She jumped when her human suddenly slapped the table. Once she was on the chair opposite him and safely out of reach she sat up and looked over at Jim.</p>\n<p>“Yep. That is it. Show it who the boss is in this neighbourhood.” He spat the words out.</p>\n<p>“Whatcha think, cat? Think we can be in charge of our own life?”</p>\n<p>He picked up his crutches, shrugged on his jacket, took his old slouch hat from the hook beside the back door, and shuffled to the door.</p>\n<p>He was careful to close it properly. Grasping the rail with his left hand, crutches in his right, he slowly hopped down the steps. When he reached the bottom he leaned on the crutches and turned from side to side to see if he was being watched. Satisfied he had not attracted any unwanted attention, he hobbled down to the street.</p>\n<p>The little black cat sauntered to the front window and watched him go. Once he got to the sidewalk and headed up the street she wandered to the kitchen to make sure she had a good heaping of food. He had responsibilities and she constantly made sure to remind him. Cannot trust him to remember on his own. Satisfied he had listened to her, she headed up to the bedroom so she could spend some time imagining how she could get that fluttery leaf out of the tree.</p>\n<p>Jim hobbled up the block and around the corner as quick as his wobbly crutches let him. He had taken the long way so he could avoid crossing in front of Margaret’s house. Now he was pressed to get to the stop before the bus heading down towards the hardware came along. Not quite sure how he was going to get a chainsaw back to the house, but blamed if that was gonna stop him. Would be time to work on that part once he got settled in the bus and caught his breath.</p>\n<p>END</p>",
				"content_text": "\n*a story*\n\nThe old man glared up at one last leaf clinging to an otherwise bare maple tree. That annoying remaining leaf was swaying in the autumn breeze, seemingly oblivious to the lateness of the season.\n\n“Waste of time, gathering up all the fallen leaves. Let them rot where they fall. That is what I should be doing. Mother knows how to take care of her own leavings. Nothing wasted with her. Ashes to ashes, leaves to dirt,“ he grumbled.\n\nJim did not see the sense in spending good energy messing with nature's job. The leaves would soon enough be gone on their own. All he had to do was ignore them until the snow covered them. Come spring, they would be mostly decayed and gone. There were better things to do than chase dry old leaves blowing around the yard, especially since as soon as he went back inside that last damned leaf would decide it was time to fall.\n\nDamn that old Maggie Miller! If not for her and her persnickety ways he would not be out in the chilly autumn air, bothering about a few dead leaves. If she was not so darn snooty about how neat and clean she kept her place, constantly telling him he ought to follow her good example so his leaves did not blow over to her yard, he would have things a lot easier. As if he controlled which way the wind blew. As if she could tell which leaves were from which tree.\n\nAs if he cared two bits about her near-constant stream of comments on his life and habits.\n\nThat darn old woman had a way of going on and on that was too darn close to being just like an old nagging wife.

You said you do not want to go to any care centre, so you have got to accept the proper care in your own house.”\n\n“Alright Margaret. I know the only way to get you out of here is to let you have a bit of your own way. But after I have a bite I am gonna lay down for a rest on my bed, and you are gonna be gone when I get up. That is the way it has to be. That is the only way I will tolerate your bothering me.”\n\nHe reached down to scoop up the little cat and stumbled forward. Margaret rushed over to steady him, but he waved her away.\n\n“Leave me alone. Stop your fussing over me. I am fine. Just need to re-establish my balances.”\n\nHe managed to gather the cat in his arm. He balanced himself carefully while he rubbed her head. She turned on her purr motor and pushed against his hand, urging it to keep going and nudging it to the right spots.\n\nTurning back to Margaret, he snarled. “Well, go on. Go make your mess in the kitchen so you can finish your meddling and get on out and leave us in peace.”\n\nShe backed off at his rising annoyance, and went into the kitchen after emitting a last note of hmmph. “Stubborn foolish ornery old man,” she muttered. “Going to need some extra looking after. Going to need me, he will soon see. Not going to be able to do much but sit around for some time to come.”\n\nJim barely had time to hobble to his worn armchair and drop his skinny body onto it before Margaret’s cry rang out from the kitchen. It echoed around the corner and burst against his ears.\n\n“Lordy, Jim. You got quite some mess in here. How long since this place got top to bottom attention? I tell you, it is going to take me some time to get this place just to the point where I can begin to fix a proper meal.”\n\nIn a non-subtle stage whisper she continued. “I do not get how anyone can go on living like this day in and day out. Not right; not good. It is just pride going before the fall.”\n\nRealizing her unintended pun, she chuckled and repeated it. “Pride before the fall. And now too much pride after the fall.”\n\nUnable to resist any longer, he called back, “I can hear you, you know. My ears ain’t busted. And I got good reason to have my pride.”\n\nAfter a pause, he could not resist a final dig, “As you full well know.”\n\nShe stood in the doorway between the two rooms, wiping her hands on a ratty grey towel. “Forty-eight years. That is a powerful lot of stubborn pride to be harbouring. You have a long long way to fall, holding on to all that pride for all that time.”\n\n“You know it was not me who ran off with some other fella while her man was away. It ain’t pride, knowing you have been done wrong to. It ain’t pride when you are out there in the mud and snow in a faraway land and you hear about your sweetheart, the one whose letters you kept right next to your heart each night, snugging up to some other fella. No sir. It was not me who ran off. So if you are gonna go and get uppity on me you best just run along right now.”\n\nMargaret put her fists on her broad hips and shook her head at him. “It is a wonder that woman you married put up with your griping and moaning for all of those years. It drove her to her early grave. I am sure of that.”\n\n“It is a wonder she came out of the same line as you, seeing as she was kind and considerate. How did she come to be your cousin anyhow? It would be like a skunk and a bluebird can be cousins. And you were not the bluebird.”\n\n“You do not need to be hollering at me, Jim. I am not trying to get you riled, telling you what you ought or ought not to be doing. I am not deserving of these hard words and you know it. Lordy, all I know is I am here trying to help you, same as usual, and you are busting all over me for it. I do not know, Jim. I ought to just give up, like you say. Let you go off and perform whatever acts of craziness you prefer and hang the consequences.”\n\n“Acts of craziness? Like hanging by you for so long? We have known each other more than half a century now. If I am so all fired crazy, why the good heck are you still here?”\n\nMargaret sighed. She dropped the towel on the sideboard and quietly walked across to his chair. She half perched on the arm of the chair and placed her hand on his arm. She started stroking her fingers across it, as if to straighten out the wayward hairs poking out at odd angles. “Oh, Jim, Jim, Jim. It is not so much that you are crazy. It is just that sometimes you get crazy notions and I get scared for you.”\n\n“Well, stop. Somehow I have managed to reach this day just fine. This day is about 78 years past my entry to this here world. Somehow, my crazy notions have not killed me yet. Maybe someday they will, but at least I will go on my terms. That is the way I want it-on my terms. Just like you want it on yours.” He shook her hand off his arm in a gesture of defiance.\n\n“Well, your way did some pretty damage this time. And if I was not here to pick up your pieces, you would be stuck in a care centre right now.”\n\n“Maybe if you were not here I would not ‘ve broke my leg. Maybe I would not have bothered about the durn leaves, since I do not mind them nearly as much as you do. How about that for a thought?” He looked off across the yard, avoiding her eyes. He did not bother about her hand this time, though.\n\n“Look, Jim. How many times do I have to tell you that you are not so young any more. It is long past time you gave up thinking you can just go and do whatever bit of foolishness comes to your fool head.”\n\n“None, Margaret. You never need to tell me anything. You always seem to want to, but you never have to. You have been pestering me for years and years, and I have been trying to not hear you for about the same years. Let it rest, Margaret. Let me finish out my life in peace. If I need you sometime, you might hear it from me. Otherwise, stop scuffing at my doorstep every day now.”\n\n“You cannot do that.”\n\n“I cannot do what, Margaret?”\n\n“You cannot tell me to get out and stay out. You need someone to look after you, to help you out until you get back up on your feet. And that someone has got to be me, since I know you best.”\n\nHe glared at her from his seat. “I told you I do not need no one to be fussing around me, trying to run my life. Least of all you. I will take care of my own self in my own way. Why not just go bother the leaves in your yard or something and leave me be now.”\n\nShe harrumphed.\n\nThe cat jumped but Jim did not even look up when the door slammed. The sun rose bright and strong the next morning. It took Jim a while to clear out the sink and restore the dishes to their rightful spots. He burned a couple slices of toast and cooked up some coffee. After his breakfast he practiced perambulating up and down the kitchen, getting a solid feel for his new three point stance. Once he was satisfied with his progress, he thump-shuffle-thumped to the front door and picked up the paper. He shuffled back to the kitchen table and eased his way onto a seat.\n\nAfter a while he became aware that he was not alone. He glanced over the top of his paper and saw the cat perched on the table. She was surveying the yard. Her wiggling rear meant there was something of interest out there. He squirmed around in his chair and looked out at the barren garden. He saw patches of dirt where a mole broke through the dry brown grass, and the thorny rosebushes along the back fence. Eventually, his eyes came to rest on the miscreant tree.\n\nHe saw the lone leaf still clinging to the otherwise barren tree. It fluttered in the breeze but showed no inclination to give up its high perch. He gripped the edge of the table until his knuckles went white.\n\n\"Bastard leaf,\" Jim mumbled. “Maybe I ought to just cut down your whole damn tree. That might show you who has got the last say.\"\n\nHe eyed the cat perched on the table. \"You know you are not supposed to be up there. Skee-daddle down now, you hear?”\n\nShe looked at him to gauge his level of seriousness. When he did not bother to push her off the table she settled her chest fur with a couple of quick licks and turned back to the window. She began to purr lightly.\n\nShe jumped when her human suddenly slapped the table. Once she was on the chair opposite him and safely out of reach she sat up and looked over at Jim.\n\n“Yep. That is it. Show it who the boss is in this neighbourhood.” He spat the words out.\n\n“Whatcha think, cat? Think we can be in charge of our own life?”\n\nHe picked up his crutches, shrugged on his jacket, took his old slouch hat from the hook beside the back door, and shuffled to the door.\n\nHe was careful to close it properly. Grasping the rail with his left hand, crutches in his right, he slowly hopped down the steps. When he reached the bottom he leaned on the crutches and turned from side to side to see if he was being watched. Satisfied he had not attracted any unwanted attention, he hobbled down to the street.\n\nThe little black cat sauntered to the front window and watched him go. Once he got to the sidewalk and headed up the street she wandered to the kitchen to make sure she had a good heaping of food. He had responsibilities and she constantly made sure to remind him. Cannot trust him to remember on his own. Satisfied he had listened to her, she headed up to the bedroom so she could spend some time imagining how she could get that fluttery leaf out of the tree.\n\nJim hobbled up the block and around the corner as quick as his wobbly crutches let him. He had taken the long way so he could avoid crossing in front of Margaret’s house. Now he was pressed to get to the stop before the bus heading down towards the hardware came along. Not quite sure how he was going to get a chainsaw back to the house, but blamed if that was gonna stop him. Would be time to work on that part once he got settled in the bus and caught his breath.\n\nEND\n",

				"content_html": "<p><em>a story</em></p>\n<p>Behind a curved counter which once dispensed knowledge in an old library, a not-quite-young woman takes requests and dispenses tonic to a queue of people in need of a good morning coffee. She is warm, friendly, speaks with a bit of a British accent, and smiles deep into peoples’ eyes. She handles the continual queue with a cheerful efficiency, showing no sign of weariness at the unending parade of patrons in need of a fix.</p>\n<p>The door opens and closes, opens and closes. The queue at the counter ebbs and flows but never fully disappears. A lot of caffeine, a lot of pick-me-up, passes across the counter. A minority of people linger in the café while they enjoy their coffee. Some await company, others relax and read a newspaper in a public place.</p>\n<p>A brown haired woman, petite and fashionable, sits a table on the side opposite the counter. She seems nervous; she confessed to the barista she was awaiting a first meeting. A cup of coffee in a public space. It is easier to get out of a bad first meeting if it is limited to a meet-and-greet over coffee. She fidgets, changes tables to be more visible and to more easily view new arrivals.</p>\n<p>The door opens. Is this the one?</p>\n<p>No, he unfolds a newspaper and settles in for a quick read, across the room from two kids and their boisterous play. How about the guy in the leather jacket? He scans the room, looking for someone. He spots his match, who turns out to be a realtor with a fat binder of local properties.</p>\n<p>The brown haired woman lightly pounds the table. Her nerves are taking over, and she cannot sit comfortably. She finally settles at a table at the front, the closest table to the door. From here she can comfortably observe the front entry. If he is as nervous as she is he may be pacing outside, gathering his courage. Perhaps he justifies his delay by the need for a last primp. Must present a good front; must make a good first impression. She is carefully prepared, especially for a weekend morning. Black jeans, black boots with uncomfortable heels, a thin but fashionable jacket. She stands in contrast to most of the other patrons, who wear casual weekend clothing.</p>\n<p>A man and woman, both past middle-age, walk in. Before they order their coffee they look around the café and walk over to greet a couple sitting in the middle of the room.</p>\n<p>“Happy Holidays,” they say.</p>\n<p>The two couples engage in a few minutes of light chatter about plans for the holidays, who is going where, and when. Their interaction is polite and superficial, providing a minimal semblance of involvement and engagement. Some fraction of it may resonate and when they again happen to meet, perhaps at the grocers, they can pick up a thread.</p>\n<p>Their conversation is not quiet. “We are not going away this year. The cat has been sick and we think it will be better to stay home and nurse her. It is probably her last holiday.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, that is sad. Has she been sick for long? I remember when our dog had leukaemia. It was so hard to watch him slipping away. We felt so helpless, and he could not tell us how he really felt.”</p>\n<p>“I know what you mean. It is hard and it is sad. Still, we are looking forward to a quiet time at home, just the two of us. I do not think we have had a holiday all to ourselves for too many years.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, I know. It is always such a busy and non-relaxing time, running around and around, preparing everything, then all the travel. Thank goodness my parents moved away. At least we cannot be expected to run between both families, or to choose which one we will see. It is so tiring and all the travel makes it seems endless. You need a holiday from the holidays sometimes.”</p>\n<p>After a few more minutes of pleasantries the newcomers move to join the queue for their coffee. The first-comers rise, don their coats, and depart. Their table sits empty for only a moment before a pair of teenage girls flutter over to it.</p>\n<p>Once more the door opens. The petite brown haired woman watches, hesitates, then stands and shows a tentative smile. The newest arrival wears a jaunty beret. Advantage to her -with few black men in the place, her task of picking out the right man is eased. He has to rely on her online picture, hoping the picture was a true one. Her recognition of him brings a smile to his face.</p>\n<p>Does he look like his picture? Does she? After a moment of hesitation they smile and exchange a perfunctory hug. It is a hug of relief; a major hurdle has been crossed. She gestures toward the counter, he smiles and walks over to place his order. She sits, visibly more relaxed. First step accomplished. He came, and on time. The greetings were comfortable.</p>\n<p>When he comes back with his coffee they move to a rear table and begin to chat, initiating the dance of finding a comfortable groove while closely assessing each other. They are overheard. After a few minutes she confesses she has not done this often, but she has talked with friends who had horror stories. Even after exchanging email, after talking on the phone, Prince Charming turns out to be a rogue, even a Neanderthal. One friend described a guy, a real charmer, who immediately suggested they skip the coffee and head to her place to ‘get more comfortable’. ‘You never know’, her friends told her. Great. Just what she needed to boost her confidence in the whole resume dating process. He nods</p>\n<p>Does the public image match the private, online, image? Does his persona fit his online messages? Is she truly the person she presented via bits and bytes? And more importantly, is this a beginning, or will this meeting spell an end to the online flirtation? Vexing questions, and a snap judgement is called for. Twenty minutes, thirty minutes, forty minutes of banter.</p>\n<p>Then, seemingly by mutual consent, they smile and rise from the table. They discard their coffee cups as they walk out the door. After a last -or is it?- hug, they part and walk off in different directions. An end, or awaiting the next chapter?</p>\n<p>An elderly couple shuffle in and claim a pair of the coveted overstuffed seats. While she settles in he shuffles to the counter to order a pair of small coffees. On his way back to his seat he picks up a newspaper left behind. While the woman sits and quietly observes the room, the man carefully reads the paper. They interact psychically, but not overtly, in the way of many long-standing couples. Aware of each others’ presence, they seem to sense each other’s presence and thoughts, not needing to be actively engaging.</p>\n<p>She picks up a section of his paper and begins skimming through it. Finding a point of interest in an article, she leans to him, points to the section that caught her, and explains briefly how it caught her. He chuckles at her explanation, then smiles before turning back to his paper. Her engagement in the paper is only partial. She frequently looks up and surveys the room, looking for other points of interest. She observed the meeting of the brown haired woman and her date, but that show ended. Must be something else of interest to watch. With all the flashy people around she must rarely be at a loss for a subject to study, and the glittery people do not mind. Many of them seem to crave attention, in the manner of showy birds flitting in trees.</p>\n<p>She slips into a quiet revery, looking lost in thoughts, memories, feelings. A couple of times she looks over at her husband, who is engrossed in his paper and oblivious to the cacophony around him. She smiles toward him. She is apparently wandering through some gentle memories. Not in a hurry to be elsewhere, they linger over coffee and the paper for almost an hour, until he finishes a section of the paper and notices her watching him. He leans towards her, nods his head toward the door, and quietly speaks. They get up stiffly, climbing out of the soft chairs with a small degree of difficulty. As he helps her with her coat, she suddenly leans to him and kisses his cheek. He holds the door for her as they leave.</p>\n<p>A young woman, apparently home from college yet trying to avoid being at home with all of its memories and cacophony, sits at a centre table. An older woman brings two lattes and a muffin. The resemblance suggests mother and daughter, out for a casual cup of coffee and a moment to catch up. It is an easy conversation, of the kind that occurs once a girl passes through her teen years, when her parents are a continual source of consternation and obtuseness, and begins to appreciate her family once more.</p>\n<p>They split the muffin, dropping crumbs on a napkin spread as an improvised tablecloth.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;How is your new schedule? Is it going to be lighter than the fall term?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I do not know. I am trying to push through the year so I can focus on my major courses next year.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;How are the distractions? Are you still seeing that guy from Indiana?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Ok, mom. First, my social life is not merely a distraction. I need a break from books sometimes. Second, that guy from Indiana had a name. Has a name. But I am not ‘seeing’ him. And to answer your next question, I am not seeing anyone right now.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I was not meaning to imply that you should not get out and have fun. I am curious. We do not see each other every day now that you are at college. I am still interested in your life.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know. It is just that I am a big girl now, and I want to be trusted to have my own life.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The daughter picks crumbs off the napkin and pops them in her mouth. She brushes her hair back with her hand, and the resemblance between mother and daughter is quite apparent. Hair, eyes, complexions. It is as if a time mirror is placed in front of them. The girl that the mother once was, and the woman the daughter will become, are at that moment visible.</p>\n<p>The moment passes and they begin catching up on events and people. After several animated minutes of conversation they pause. The daughter has a direct and open look, and she tilts her head in a quizzical manner while her mother talks. Mother looks at daughter and smiles. She reaches over and squeezes her daughter’s hand.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Shall we go shopping now?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The daughter stops at the washroom, then they walk out arm in arm, the girl seemingly not embarrassed to be seen with her mother now that she has gained some independence.</p>\n<p>Two tables each contain a pair of women, neighbours or friends, taking a moment away from the fast pace of the week to relax, converse, and commiserate.</p>\n<p>At a rear table two women discuss their kids, share holiday menus, vacations plans, and goals for the coming year. One of the women has two young children. After finishing their hot chocolate the kids are charged up and fidgety. The older one, a boy about 4 years old, twists and squirms in his seat. The squirming picks up pace until it becomes a dance around the seat of his chair. Eventually, he probes the floor with his foot.</p>\n<p>Upon finding that there is no immediate response from his mother he slides off the seat and begins exploring the underside of the table. From there it is a short move to exploring the neighbouring tables, then doing laps around the room. Several half-hearted attempts by his mother to settle him fail, and the younger child decides to join in the fun. Faster and faster, louder and louder -their boisterousness becomes a nuisance for others, until their mother gives up and gives chase to pack them up. This only incites further rowdiness, with one escaping while the other is corralled. Eventually, with the help of her companion, the mother herds both kids out the door. So much for a few moments to relax with a friend.</p>\n<p>At a front table two women lean toward each other across the table. One of the women has brown hair pinned up on her head, revealing blonde streaks. She wears worn blue jeans, a brown sweater over an orange t-shirt, and sheepskin boots. She has a look and physical attitude of someone who has dealt with plenty of nonsense, who has fought her share of battles and is prepared to fight more if necessary. Her face is worn and lined, her eyes -easily her best feature- are large and dark.</p>\n<p>Her companion looks younger, fresh-faced and relaxed. Her dark hair is worn loose, draping over her shoulders. Her style is a bit more coordinated, but still comfortably casual. Neither woman appears to be in a hurry, as if they were squeezing in a few moments in a tight schedule. Their cups go mostly untouched, their conversation dominating their time.</p>\n<p>The younger-looking woman seems to be trying to sort out a relationship.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I just cannot figure out who it is I am with. He is as sweet as could be one day, then foul and sarcastic the next. It is hard, not knowing which person is going to be at my door.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I know he really likes you. He can be a real dumbass, but he sees good things in you, and he really likes you.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I was falling in love with him until this other side of him started showing up. Now I question the whole relationship. Has he always been like this?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;He has been a sort of a roller coaster for a long time. Ever since Dad died, in fact. I was 12, so he was about 8. That is 24 years of up and down stuff.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&quot; And how has he kept it hidden for so long?&quot;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, it was not always hidden. Dad kept our mother on an even keel. When dad died she fell apart. He took the brunt of it. He learned to cope by developing a bite, a dark sarcasm. After he left for college, he calmed down and became the sweet guy you first saw.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;And where did that guy go? And why? Why now? Why me?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I think you two are getting close and the other close relationship in his life was with mother. So maybe some of that old frustration and fear is coming in to your relationship now. It reflects how he views close relationships: potentially ending and causing pain.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So what do I do? Do I bag it and get out now, or is there hope? I know you are biased. You are his sister; his only relative. But I have to ask you because you know him best.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I am not going to apologize for him, or make excuses for him. If he is a dumbass, I will call him a dumbass. But I like you. I see you guys are good together. Maybe we can work on it for a bit before you give up.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;How? What do you suggest?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;How about you guys come over to my place? I will tell him to come at 7 and lay it out to him. Tell him he is an idiot if he loses you because he cannot properly appreciate you and treat you right. Then you come about 8, and we will talk to him together.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Do you think it will help?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I hope so. I love my baby brother I and want him to be happy. If he needs to be slapped upside the head and made to see what is good for him, I will do it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Woman two laughs. She watches as a group of women sit at a nearby table and place a baby carrier on one seat. Smiling at the baby, she turns back to her coffee and conversation.</p>\n<p>The baby carrier crowds the table. There appear to be three, maybe four, generations represented at this table, counting the baby. The senior woman is young to be a grandmother; perhaps the middle generation has two widely separated children, an early 20’s woman and the baby. It is not readily apparent who the baby’s mother is: the middle woman or the young one.</p>\n<p>The women chatter busily, keeping two or three conversations going at once. The baby does not have a coffee, so she is not as hyperactive as the others at the table. The women are clearly accustomed to this style of multithreaded conversations, but the din from their table is baffling to onlookers. The baby has some learning to do in order to keep up with her family, but at the moment she prepares for it by napping.</p>\n<p>The coffee break looks like a quick stop in their day. After about 15 minutes of chatter the women move on, to the obvious relief of the next table over.</p>\n<p>A young girl, high school age, sits on the side with her laptop and a notebook. Remarkably, for a teenager with a computer, she is doing schoolwork rather than chatting online or otherwise finding distraction on the Internet.</p>\n<p>After a while an older woman comes up to her and introduces herself. The woman is an alumnus of the college, as shown by her badge and her college-labelled notebook. In a low key manner the woman conducts an admission interview. She encourages the girl to talk about her strengths and goals, her other school prospects, her plans for life. They talk about other schools the girl is interested in, and some of the differences between the various schools. They discuss possible careers and how difficult it can be to decide on a plan for study and, by extension, for life, at this point in the girl’s life.</p>\n<p>Before parting the woman makes a pitch for the school. She describes her experiences and her pathway through her school career. After half an hour the interview ends. The woman stands, takes her coat, and shakes the girl’s hand. The woman gets a cup of coffee and departs. The girl turns back to her computer and continues her work.</p>\n<p>A middle aged man, looking a bit rough around the edges in this region of pristine denizens, surfs the Internet on his older pre-modern laptop. He has a bag stuffed with papers and gear and has spread his setup into the equivalent of a portable messy desk. Papers and notebooks are spread across two chairs, while computer, mobile phone, headphones, mouse, and coffee cup consume the entire table top. His appearance, and his demeanour, match the disarray of his portable office.</p>\n<p>He is not satisfied with something he sees on his screen, and he makes little chuffing noises. His expression darkens. He takes a notebook and flips through it. Not finding what he is looking for, he flips through the sheets again, with obvious frustration. His noises and his actions make the young girl with the laptop uncomfortable. She is at an adjacent table, and she looks over at him. She shifts slightly, as if an additional 10 cm of distance will ensure her safety.</p>\n<p>His phone rings. He glares at the screen, then answers the phone with a gruff &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>His responses to the caller are loud and aggressive. He attracts scowls, but is oblivious to the effect he is having on the mood of the shop. He abruptly ends the call and gathers his things. He haphazardly stuffs them in his bag, and nearly upsets the table when he suddenly stands. As he storms out the door, a chill breeze rushes out.</p>\n<p>An elderly man walks in and rearranges an easy chair and a side table, positioning them so he can reach his drink easily. He sits alone and reads a tabloid. He keeps his jacket zipped to the collar and his red baseball cap on his head. His foot occasionally taps in time with the music playing in the shop, seemingly responding on its own. He is hunkered down and does not give the impression of a toe tapper.</p>\n<p>His appearance, his careful rearrangement of the furniture, his attitude, give an impression of fastidiousness and a straight arrow approach to life. Perhaps his life has been an unending, unyielding succession of predictable or controlled events, and that pattern continues into his later years. Or, perhaps, he was a wild one, a hellion in his youth, and he is now straightening his curvy path through life.</p>\n<p>Either possibility is easy to imagine. His jaunty baseball cap and athletic shoes are not congruent with his tightly fastened jacket and his pinched mouth. Perhaps he has a thousand and one great life stories to tell. Or, after a long narrow life, he is boring as hell. No one risks finding out, and he does not invite interaction. Eventually, after a long hour of slowly perusing the worthless paper, he carefully folds it, tucks it under his arm, and stops at the washroom before leaving.</p>\n<p>As the day turns from morning to afternoon the sun disappears behind thickening clouds. The wind gusts and a few first snowflakes fall, swirling and dancing. The barista goes outside to capture a sidewalk sign that is threatening to become airborne. She looks up at the impending snowstorm before heading back inside to the warm smell of fresh-ground coffee. Perhaps there will be a white blanket for the holiday this year.</p>\n<p>Back inside, the writer in the back corner continues to tap-tap on their keyboard.</p>",

It is easier to get out of a bad first meeting if it is limited to a meet-and-greet over coffee. She fidgets, changes tables to be more visible and to more easily view new arrivals.\n\nThe door opens. Is this the one?\n\n<!--more-->\n\nNo, he unfolds a newspaper and settles in for a quick read, across the room from two kids and their boisterous play. How about the guy in the leather jacket? He scans the room, looking for someone. He spots his match, who turns out to be a realtor with a fat binder of local properties.\n\nThe brown haired woman lightly pounds the table. Her nerves are taking over, and she cannot sit comfortably. She finally settles at a table at the front, the closest table to the door. From here she can comfortably observe the front entry. If he is as nervous as she is he may be pacing outside, gathering his courage. Perhaps he justifies his delay by the need for a last primp. Must present a good front; must make a good first impression. She is carefully prepared, especially for a weekend morning. Black jeans, black boots with uncomfortable heels, a thin but fashionable jacket. She stands in contrast to most of the other patrons, who wear casual weekend clothing.\n\nA man and woman, both past middle-age, walk in. Before they order their coffee they look around the café and walk over to greet a couple sitting in the middle of the room.\n\n“Happy Holidays,” they say.\n\nThe two couples engage in a few minutes of light chatter about plans for the holidays, who is going where, and when. Their interaction is polite and superficial, providing a minimal semblance of involvement and engagement. Some fraction of it may resonate and when they again happen to meet, perhaps at the grocers, they can pick up a thread.\n\nTheir conversation is not quiet. “We are not going away this year. The cat has been sick and we think it will be better to stay home and nurse her. It is probably her last holiday.”\n\n“Oh, that is sad. Has she been sick for long? I remember when our dog had leukaemia. It was so hard to watch him slipping away. We felt so helpless, and he could not tell us how he really felt.”\n\n“I know what you mean. It is hard and it is sad. Still, we are looking forward to a quiet time at home, just the two of us. I do not think we have had a holiday all to ourselves for too many years.”\n\n“Oh, I know. It is always such a busy and non-relaxing time, running around and around, preparing everything, then all the travel. Thank goodness my parents moved away. At least we cannot be expected to run between both families, or to choose which one we will see. It is so tiring and all the travel makes it seems endless. You need a holiday from the holidays sometimes.”\n\nAfter a few more minutes of pleasantries the newcomers move to join the queue for their coffee. The first-comers rise, don their coats, and depart. Their table sits empty for only a moment before a pair of teenage girls flutter over to it.\n\nOnce more the door opens. The petite brown haired woman watches, hesitates, then stands and shows a tentative smile. The newest arrival wears a jaunty beret. Advantage to her -with few black men in the place, her task of picking out the right man is eased. He has to rely on her online picture, hoping the picture was a true one. Her recognition of him brings a smile to his face.\n\nDoes he look like his picture? Does she? After a moment of hesitation they smile and exchange a perfunctory hug. It is a hug of relief; a major hurdle has been crossed. She gestures toward the counter, he smiles and walks over to place his order. She sits, visibly more relaxed. First step accomplished. He came, and on time. The greetings were comfortable.\n\nWhen he comes back with his coffee they move to a rear table and begin to chat, initiating the dance of finding a comfortable groove while closely assessing each other. They are overheard. After a few minutes she confesses she has not done this often, but she has talked with friends who had horror stories. Even after exchanging email, after talking on the phone, Prince Charming turns out to be a rogue, even a Neanderthal. One friend described a guy, a real charmer, who immediately suggested they skip the coffee and head to her place to ‘get more comfortable’. ‘You never know’, her friends told her. Great. Just what she needed to boost her confidence in the whole resume dating process. He nods\n\nDoes the public image match the private, online, image? Does his persona fit his online messages? Is she truly the person she presented via bits and bytes? And more importantly, is this a beginning, or will this meeting spell an end to the online flirtation? Vexing questions, and a snap judgement is called for. Twenty minutes, thirty minutes, forty minutes of banter.\n\nThen, seemingly by mutual consent, they smile and rise from the table. They discard their coffee cups as they walk out the door. After a last -or is it?- hug, they part and walk off in different directions. An end, or awaiting the next chapter?\n\nAn elderly couple shuffle in and claim a pair of the coveted overstuffed seats. While she settles in he shuffles to the counter to order a pair of small coffees. On his way back to his seat he picks up a newspaper left behind. While the woman sits and quietly observes the room, the man carefully reads the paper. They interact psychically, but not overtly, in the way of many long-standing couples. Aware of each others’ presence, they seem to sense each other’s presence and thoughts, not needing to be actively engaging.\n\nShe picks up a section of his paper and begins skimming through it. Finding a point of interest in an article, she leans to him, points to the section that caught her, and explains briefly how it caught her. He chuckles at her explanation, then smiles before turning back to his paper. Her engagement in the paper is only partial. She frequently looks up and surveys the room, looking for other points of interest. She observed the meeting of the brown haired woman and her date, but that show ended. Must be something else of interest to watch. With all the flashy people around she must rarely be at a loss for a subject to study, and the glittery people do not mind. Many of them seem to crave attention, in the manner of showy birds flitting in trees.\n\nShe slips into a quiet revery, looking lost in thoughts, memories, feelings. A couple of times she looks over at her husband, who is engrossed in his paper and oblivious to the cacophony around him. She smiles toward him. She is apparently wandering through some gentle memories. Not in a hurry to be elsewhere, they linger over coffee and the paper for almost an hour, until he finishes a section of the paper and notices her watching him. He leans towards her, nods his head toward the door, and quietly speaks. They get up stiffly, climbing out of the soft chairs with a small degree of difficulty. As he helps her with her coat, she suddenly leans to him and kisses his cheek. He holds the door for her as they leave.\n\nA young woman, apparently home from college yet trying to avoid being at home with all of its memories and cacophony, sits at a centre table. An older woman brings two lattes and a muffin. The resemblance suggests mother and daughter, out for a casual cup of coffee and a moment to catch up. It is an easy conversation, of the kind that occurs once a girl passes through her teen years, when her parents are a continual source of consternation and obtuseness, and begins to appreciate her family once more.\n\nThey split the muffin, dropping crumbs on a napkin spread as an improvised tablecloth.\n\n\"How is your new schedule? Is it going to be lighter than the fall term?\"\n\n\"I do not know. I am trying to push through the year so I can focus on my major courses next year.\"\n\n\"How are the distractions? Are you still seeing that guy from Indiana?\"\n\n\"Ok, mom. First, my social life is not merely a distraction. I need a break from books sometimes. Second, that guy from Indiana had a name. Has a name. But I am not ‘seeing’ him. And to answer your next question, I am not seeing anyone right now.\"\n\n\"I was not meaning to imply that you should not get out and have fun. I am curious. We do not see each other every day now that you are at college. I am still interested in your life.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know. It is just that I am a big girl now, and I want to be trusted to have my own life.\"\n\nThe daughter picks crumbs off the napkin and pops them in her mouth. She brushes her hair back with her hand, and the resemblance between mother and daughter is quite apparent. Hair, eyes, complexions. It is as if a time mirror is placed in front of them. The girl that the mother once was, and the woman the daughter will become, are at that moment visible.\n\nThe moment passes and they begin catching up on events and people. After several animated minutes of conversation they pause. The daughter has a direct and open look, and she tilts her head in a quizzical manner while her mother talks. Mother looks at daughter and smiles. She reaches over and squeezes her daughter’s hand.\n\n\"Shall we go shopping now?\"\n\nThe daughter stops at the washroom, then they walk out arm in arm, the girl seemingly not embarrassed to be seen with her mother now that she has gained some independence.\n\nTwo tables each contain a pair of women, neighbours or friends, taking a moment away from the fast pace of the week to relax, converse, and commiserate.\n\nAt a rear table two women discuss their kids, share holiday menus, vacations plans, and goals for the coming year. One of the women has two young children. After finishing their hot chocolate the kids are charged up and fidgety. The older one, a boy about 4 years old, twists and squirms in his seat. The squirming picks up pace until it becomes a dance around the seat of his chair. Eventually, he probes the floor with his foot.\n\nUpon finding that there is no immediate response from his mother he slides off the seat and begins exploring the underside of the table. From there it is a short move to exploring the neighbouring tables, then doing laps around the room. Several half-hearted attempts by his mother to settle him fail, and the younger child decides to join in the fun. Faster and faster, louder and louder -their boisterousness becomes a nuisance for others, until their mother gives up and gives chase to pack them up. This only incites further rowdiness, with one escaping while the other is corralled. Eventually, with the help of her companion, the mother herds both kids out the door. So much for a few moments to relax with a friend.\n\nAt a front table two women lean toward each other across the table. One of the women has brown hair pinned up on her head, revealing blonde streaks. She wears worn blue jeans, a brown sweater over an orange t-shirt, and sheepskin boots. She has a look and physical attitude of someone who has dealt with plenty of nonsense, who has fought her share of battles and is prepared to fight more if necessary. Her face is worn and lined, her eyes -easily her best feature- are large and dark.\n\nHer companion looks younger, fresh-faced and relaxed. Her dark hair is worn loose, draping over her shoulders. Her style is a bit more coordinated, but still comfortably casual. Neither woman appears to be in a hurry, as if they were squeezing in a few moments in a tight schedule. Their cups go mostly untouched, their conversation dominating their time.\n\nThe younger-looking woman seems to be trying to sort out a relationship.\n\n\"I just cannot figure out who it is I am with. He is as sweet as could be one day, then foul and sarcastic the next. It is hard, not knowing which person is going to be at my door.\"\n\n\"I know he really likes you. He can be a real dumbass, but he sees good things in you, and he really likes you.\"\n\n\"I was falling in love with him until this other side of him started showing up. Now I question the whole relationship. Has he always been like this?\"\n\n\"He has been a sort of a roller coaster for a long time. Ever since Dad died, in fact. I was 12, so he was about 8. That is 24 years of up and down stuff.\"\n\n\" And how has he kept it hidden for so long?\"\n\n\"Oh, it was not always hidden. Dad kept our mother on an even keel. When dad died she fell apart. He took the brunt of it. He learned to cope by developing a bite, a dark sarcasm. After he left for college, he calmed down and became the sweet guy you first saw.\"\n\n\"And where did that guy go? And why? Why now? Why me?\"\n\n\"I think you two are getting close and the other close relationship in his life was with mother. So maybe some of that old frustration and fear is coming in to your relationship now. It reflects how he views close relationships: potentially ending and causing pain.\"\n\n\"So what do I do? Do I bag it and get out now, or is there hope? I know you are biased. You are his sister; his only relative. But I have to ask you because you know him best.\"\n\n\"I am not going to apologize for him, or make excuses for him. If he is a dumbass, I will call him a dumbass. But I like you. I see you guys are good together. Maybe we can work on it for a bit before you give up.\"\n\n\"How? What do you suggest?\"\n\n\"How about you guys come over to my place? I will tell him to come at 7 and lay it out to him. Tell him he is an idiot if he loses you because he cannot properly appreciate you and treat you right. Then you come about 8, and we will talk to him together.\"\n\n\"Do you think it will help?\"\n\n\"I hope so. I love my baby brother I and want him to be happy. If he needs to be slapped upside the head and made to see what is good for him, I will do it.\"\n\nWoman two laughs. She watches as a group of women sit at a nearby table and place a baby carrier on one seat. Smiling at the baby, she turns back to her coffee and conversation.\n\nThe baby carrier crowds the table. There appear to be three, maybe four, generations represented at this table, counting the baby. The senior woman is young to be a grandmother; perhaps the middle generation has two widely separated children, an early 20’s woman and the baby. It is not readily apparent who the baby’s mother is: the middle woman or the young one.\n\nThe women chatter busily, keeping two or three conversations going at once. The baby does not have a coffee, so she is not as hyperactive as the others at the table. The women are clearly accustomed to this style of multithreaded conversations, but the din from their table is baffling to onlookers. The baby has some learning to do in order to keep up with her family, but at the moment she prepares for it by napping.\n\nThe coffee break looks like a quick stop in their day. After about 15 minutes of chatter the women move on, to the obvious relief of the next table over.\n\nA young girl, high school age, sits on the side with her laptop and a notebook. Remarkably, for a teenager with a computer, she is doing schoolwork rather than chatting online or otherwise finding distraction on the Internet.\n\nAfter a while an older woman comes up to her and introduces herself. The woman is an alumnus of the college, as shown by her badge and her college-labelled notebook. In a low key manner the woman conducts an admission interview. She encourages the girl to talk about her strengths and goals, her other school prospects, her plans for life. They talk about other schools the girl is interested in, and some of the differences between the various schools. They discuss possible careers and how difficult it can be to decide on a plan for study and, by extension, for life, at this point in the girl’s life.\n\nBefore parting the woman makes a pitch for the school. She describes her experiences and her pathway through her school career. After half an hour the interview ends. The woman stands, takes her coat, and shakes the girl’s hand. The woman gets a cup of coffee and departs. The girl turns back to her computer and continues her work.\n\nA middle aged man, looking a bit rough around the edges in this region of pristine denizens, surfs the Internet on his older pre-modern laptop. He has a bag stuffed with papers and gear and has spread his setup into the equivalent of a portable messy desk. Papers and notebooks are spread across two chairs, while computer, mobile phone, headphones, mouse, and coffee cup consume the entire table top. His appearance, and his demeanour, match the disarray of his portable office.\n\nHe is not satisfied with something he sees on his screen, and he makes little chuffing noises. His expression darkens. He takes a notebook and flips through it. Not finding what he is looking for, he flips through the sheets again, with obvious frustration. His noises and his actions make the young girl with the laptop uncomfortable. She is at an adjacent table, and she looks over at him. She shifts slightly, as if an additional 10 cm of distance will ensure her safety.\n\nHis phone rings. He glares at the screen, then answers the phone with a gruff \"What?\"\n\nHis responses to the caller are loud and aggressive. He attracts scowls, but is oblivious to the effect he is having on the mood of the shop. He abruptly ends the call and gathers his things. He haphazardly stuffs them in his bag, and nearly upsets the table when he suddenly stands. As he storms out the door, a chill breeze rushes out.\n\nAn elderly man walks in and rearranges an easy chair and a side table, positioning them so he can reach his drink easily. He sits alone and reads a tabloid. He keeps his jacket zipped to the collar and his red baseball cap on his head. His foot occasionally taps in time with the music playing in the shop, seemingly responding on its own. He is hunkered down and does not give the impression of a toe tapper.\n\nHis appearance, his careful rearrangement of the furniture, his attitude, give an impression of fastidiousness and a straight arrow approach to life. Perhaps his life has been an unending, unyielding succession of predictable or controlled events, and that pattern continues into his later years. Or, perhaps, he was a wild one, a hellion in his youth, and he is now straightening his curvy path through life.\n\nEither possibility is easy to imagine. His jaunty baseball cap and athletic shoes are not congruent with his tightly fastened jacket and his pinched mouth. Perhaps he has a thousand and one great life stories to tell. Or, after a long narrow life, he is boring as hell. No one risks finding out, and he does not invite interaction. Eventually, after a long hour of slowly perusing the worthless paper, he carefully folds it, tucks it under his arm, and stops at the washroom before leaving.\n\nAs the day turns from morning to afternoon the sun disappears behind thickening clouds. The wind gusts and a few first snowflakes fall, swirling and dancing. The barista goes outside to capture a sidewalk sign that is threatening to become airborne. She looks up at the impending snowstorm before heading back inside to the warm smell of fresh-ground coffee. Perhaps there will be a white blanket for the holiday this year.\n\nBack inside, the writer in the back corner continues to tap-tap on their keyboard.\n",

				"content_html": "<p><em>a story</em></p>\n<p>John Taylor Edgar Smith –always John Taylor Edgar; never Johnnie, or JT, or any other cut-rate variant of his full given name– was a dealer in cut-rate used souls. A soul pawnbroker. In fact, he pretty much developed the whole business of buying and selling used souls. He sort of backed into the niche while sort of trying to bail out what was left of his own soul.</p>\n<p>John Taylor Edgar Smith was not the first to make money in the soul business. Preachers and prophets have been dealing in souls for quite a while, engaging in things as morally and ethically questionable as selling dispensations to personages seeking an expedient pathway to eternal glory and everlasting grace without the bother of actually conducting their lives in a manner conducive to attaining eternal glory and everlasting grace.</p>\n<p>John Taylor Edgar Smith&rsquo;s forebears, many hops down his convoluted family tree, engaged in various and occasionally rather creative but inevitably dubious and/or nefarious activities, but they never dealt in the business of souls. Have to draw a line somewhere. Leave that business for the church.</p>\n<p>Still, the aptitude for behaviour outside the norm was deeply bred into him. Without really trying, he managed to live up to his familial heritage. Or down to it, depending on who was doing the observing. John Taylor Edgar Smith eventually managed to extend his heritage by devising a wholly new form of commerce.</p>\n<p>He did so by developing the business of dealing in the shady world of soul-trading. Soul pawning. He essentially invented that world, and through sheer cussed perseverance built it into a tidy and extremely profitable business. There eventually came a time when you could find a John Taylor Edgar Smith Soul Brokerage(TM) in most any town of any reasonable size. Souls are abundant, as is misery and circumstance and bad luck.</p>\n<p>John Taylor Edgar&rsquo;s foray into the business of trading used souls stretched back a while. It stretched back to a time when he was really down, and just about out. It started from a confluence of events which could only happen to someone whose wingtips were scuffed and worn from frequent kicking against hard ground. Sometimes opportunity presents itself only to people in extraordinary circumstances. People who are getting by with some form of plain ordinary life don&rsquo;t generally find themselves in extraordinary circumstances.</p>\n<p>Some years back, things had not been going all that well in the plain ordinary business of John Taylor Edgar&rsquo;s life.</p>\n<p>What with more than a few ducked obligations and a surfeit of just plain ugly luck, his life&rsquo;s trajectory was less than stellar. In fact, until he entered the used soul world the high point of John Taylor Edgar&rsquo;s life was probably about two days before he emerged from his mother’s womb and found himself blinking up at the world. From that point on, until one dusty afternoon a long convoluted thirty-some years later, things in his life were on a steadily descending trajectory to nowhere.</p>\n<p>John Taylor Edgar&rsquo;s down-and-outedness eventually reached the point where he began pawning most of the portable articles in Darlene&rsquo;s house. Darlene was off spending a winter trying to save some poor lost heathen souls through the tired old method of patching holes in the tin siding and scrounged roofs of their poor dwellings. A handful of roofs got patched by Darlene and her soul-savers group, but few souls were actually saved. Meanwhile, John Taylor Edgar Smith was working on dismantling a major portion of the life she left behind.</p>\n<p>When Darlene slipped into her letters a line or two too many about how splendid Thomas was at the whole soul-saving business and how splendidly Thomas was showing her new ways to see the light, even in the pitch dark of a patched hut somewhere in the deep hinterlands of equatorial dark lands, and especially how much Thomas was into her, well, John Taylor Edgar could read between the lines of her ever-less frequent letters. He knew she did not mean Thomas was into her in a metaphorical sense.</p>\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t much of a surprise to him anyway.</p>\n<p>Darlene was becoming more uptight and naggy about John Taylor Edgar Smith&rsquo;s ways long before she went off to save heathen souls. It seemed to him she was just warming up for the big job: John Taylor Edgar Smith&rsquo;s soul. She had begun working on John Taylor Edgar and his misbegotten ways right away after she hooked up with the All World One Power Healing Ministry and started going to prayer meetings two, sometimes three times a week.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Cut your hair and clean up your appearance, John Taylor Edgar Smith.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Get a decent clean steady job, John Taylor Edgar Smith.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Come to the prayer meeting with me and get straight in your life, John Taylor Edgar Smith.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>One day Darlene came home with stars in her eyes and a new purpose for her life. &ldquo;We are called to grace. We are called to fix things for souls in dark lands, and show them the way to fix their souls. I am going to dark lands to heal souls and gain grace for my soul. Me and my Tuesday prayer and healing team are going to go ease the journey for a few tortured souls. But we will keep praying for your soul. Even when we are healing souls in dark lands, we will be seeking healing for your tortured soul back here.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>John Taylor Edgar waved goodbye to Darlene as she embarked for the distant shores. At first her letters came in waves, two or four at a time, one or two times per week. Then they came in trickles, no more than one or two per week.</p>\n<p>Eventually even the trickle faded into the sand. Perhaps the hot sun of the dark lands evaporated the ink in her pen, John Taylor Edgar scoffed. He could read between the lines; he could read what she did not write.</p>\n<p>&lsquo;Goodbye Darlene,&rsquo; thought John Taylor Edgar after a couple of weeks went by without a letter.</p>\n<p>He sat on the sagging orangey-yellow sofa in the small house they once shared. The room was steeped in twilight, which blended and blurred with the dimness within his mind. For a long time he stared at nothing in particular, lost in thoughts of nothing in particular. Gradually, his personal twilight faded. He looked about and saw his ticket to his own personal grace staring right back at him.</p>\n<p>John Taylor Edgar began to think Darlene surely did not need all those extra rings and blings she left behind, stashed in a shoebox at the bottom of a pile in the back of her closet.</p>\n<p>And she was not ever going to learn to play on her daddy&rsquo;s old guitar, no matter how many times she said she was. A custom-made 12-stringer, no less. Probably made with rare wood from an endangered tree cut down behind the patched hut in the dark lands where Darlene and Thomas were showing each other new ways to see the light in the middle of the dark equatorial night.</p>\n<p>It was also likely that splendid Thomas would find no good use for that shotgun stashed in the closet. Best to get it out of the way before he tried to figure out how to point it and ended up blasting his foot off. Or blasting John Taylor Edgar&rsquo;s head off, if they happened to figure out that it was not a sneak-thief that made off with the dishes.</p>\n<p>Oh, and John Taylor Edgar found the keys to the old Buick. Somehow they had ended up taped to the back of the refrigerator. As if he was not to be trusted with that old cranky Buick.</p>\n<p>Now that he had the keys he might as well borrow the blue Buick. After all, he could not very well carry all Darlene’s not-needed stuff on his person. Besides, an old vehicle, especially a Buick, needs to run occasionally, lest the rust and rot sets in. And they surely would not let him board the bus carrying a shotgun and a guitar and dragging a duffel or two. A man certainly needed some form of transportation. Even a rusty old Buick would suffice, given the right set of circumstances.</p>\n<p>Since splendid Thomas and Darlene would be used to seeking out a shady spot to rest over there in the dark lands, John Taylor Edgar might as well do her a favour and get that rusty old Buick out from under the shade tree back here at home. He could make room under the shade tree for a swing, or a blanket, or whatever else they were finding pleasure on over there in that dark village. Besides each other, of course.</p>\n<p>So the old Buick became John Taylor Edgar Smith’s ride to Grace. On the road to Grace, he exhausted four different pawnshops while trying to spread the wealth around a bit. Interesting business, he was thinking after a hour of wrangling with the ornery old cuss at pawnshop no.2. Trade your old worn goods for some ready cash, with a promise that when you were flush again you could reclaim what was rightfully yours.</p>\n<p>Or what might rightfully have been Darlene&rsquo;s, as the case might be. But that is just details. Point was, here was a means to trade up or down, depending on your needs and abilities. Pick up serviceable goods that did not currently service their previous owners’ needs. Drop off serviceable goods that did not currently service their current owners’ needs. Not as much as cash did, at any rate. And coming up with cash was John Taylor Edgar&rsquo;s immediate goal.</p>\n<p>Anyway, after pawnshop no.4 the Buick was cleaned out and John Taylor Edgar&rsquo;s wallet was fatter than it had been in a long time. A long, long time. His wallet was now fat with dirty old Darlene-derived cash and the old Darlene Buick was clean.</p>\n<p>John Taylor Edgar’s last stop before entering into Grace was Eddie&rsquo;s Autos. -&ldquo;We pay top, We sell botton…&rdquo; - proclaimed a vintage billboard leaning lazily towards the road. The turn into Eddie&rsquo;s Autos popped up just before a big lazy westward turn on the road leading across the mountains and into Grace. Two roads diverged at the far side of Grace. He would make up his mind which one to take when he got there. Probably would not matter which one, he guessed.</p>\n<p>By this time John Taylor Edgar was so ornery and worn out from so much fussing and arguing with cranky old cusses sitting on stools behind high counters trying to squeeze every last nickel out of each dime deal that he nearly immediately got right into Eddie of Eddie&rsquo;s Autos (&ldquo;We pay top, we sell botton…”).</p>\n<p>John Taylor Edgar got himself ready to give Eddie of Eddie’s Autos what-for about the old Buick, what with its clearly prime condition and state of mechanical functioning, almost as soon as Eddie started in with a clearly practiced routine of walking slowly &lsquo;round and &lsquo;round the old blue and white finned beast, shaking his head every few steps.</p>\n<p>John Taylor Edgar got good and annoyed with Eddie of Eddie&rsquo;s Autos pretty quick, what with Eddie muttering disparaging remarks and punctuating them with negative shakes of his head at about every second step.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Not good, not good. Look at that old metal. Likely to be loose and rattly, leastways wherever it is not rusted up tighter’n a wrench can bust loose. Gonna be tough to move this beast. Not sure I wanna try. Least not for more than a few hundred.&rdquo; Eddie&rsquo;s mutterings were clearly meant to be overheard.</p>\n<p>Eddie scuffed and kicked the dry dirt as he shuffled along. Pushed his fists deep into his faded khaki pockets, pulled them out to rap on a fender or poke at a tire, pushed them back into his khakis. Periodically he would stop, rock back on his heels, and slide his hands through his old dry leather suspenders and interlock them over his rather consequential belly. In this pose he would stand and stare at some object for an interval longer than seemed absolutely necessary for discerning whatever it was he obviously felt needed discerning.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What is all that muttering supposed to mean? You are fixing to lowball me, that is what I reckon. And see that sign right up there? Ya’ll say ‘We pay top’! But it sounds like you got things a mite topsy-turvy. Sounds like you mean to pay me bottom so&rsquo;s you can sucker some bigger fool into paying you top. And what the smelly hell is a ‘botto’ anyway?” John Taylor Edgar tried to clue Eddie of Eddie’s Autos that he was not any old fool and Eddie of Eddie’s Autos should not expect to shake him down with ornery ways and obtuse shakes of his shiny fat head.</p>\n<p>Well, John Taylor Edgar and Eddie of Eddie&rsquo;s Autos went at it for hours, long and roundabout. It was a slow afternoon at Eddie&rsquo;s Autos, which John Taylor Edgar figured was often the case. And John Taylor Edgar was not in much of a hurry to get anywhere down the road, seeing as Darlene was not likely to be chasing after him all too soon and he had nowhere special -and nowhere non-special, come to think of it- he needed to be.</p>\n<p>Eventually they stopped cussing at each other. They paused to draw breath, lean back in a pair of slowly rusting chairs on the shady side of Eddie&rsquo;s Autos, and down a pair of cold ones Eddie produced from a grimy top-load freezer hidden in plain sight in a dark dusty back corner of the dark dusty former shipping container now serving ignominiously as the Head Office for Eddie’s Autos. This grandiose statement the sign over the door proclaimed in faded and uneven brush strokes. John Taylor Edgar almost asked if the paint ran out while Eddie was scrawling the Head Office sign, or while he was splashing the word ‘bottom’ on the roadside sign.</p>\n<p>Head Office - Eddie&rsquo;s Autos. No mention that it was the only office for Eddie&rsquo;s Autos. It could equally say Tail Office - Eddie&rsquo;s Autos. One and Only Office - Eddie&rsquo;s Autos. Or just plain &rsquo;the office&rsquo;. Small &rsquo;t&rsquo;, small &lsquo;o&rsquo;.</p>\n<p>Eddie of Eddie&rsquo;s Autos tilted his head and looked sidelong at John Taylor Edgar. An awkward grimacing motion, probably a sort of malformed grin, tried to crawl onto his droopy wrinkly face. It did not succeed on account of the flaccid and flabby smile-forming muscles being long out of practice, but it was clearly a different sort of expression for Eddie&rsquo;s face and it clean stopped John Taylor Edgar right in the middle of his twelfth or fifteenth time of pointing out how much tread was left on those two Firestones on the front, which definitely added at least another $50 to the value of the old Buick, dang-it-all.</p>\n<p>Eddie&rsquo;s wrangling suddenly moved from autos to souls. John Taylor Edgar&rsquo;s soul in particular, although neither Eddie nor John Taylor Edgar would have said so. Not at first. Eddie had not spent a couple of lifetimes hustling dollars from folks without picking up some tricks along the way. One of those tricks was the ability to ignore his culpability, aka his conscience. Perhaps aka his soul.</p>\n<p>John Taylor Edgar was the first to introduce the concept. &ldquo;Now let me get this idea straight in my head. Sounds like you are suggesting I sit here beside you each and every day, drumming up ways to squeeze an extra fifty or five hundred dollars out of folks who happen to need a barely running clunker and who happen to wander across the fine line separating Eddie&rsquo;s Autos from the real world.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He paused to swipe the back of his sleeve across the dust and sweat on the tip of his nose. &ldquo;That fine line I point to is the one out there where the dust at the edge of the road starts to mix with the dust from the potholes at the end of the turnout into Eddie&rsquo;s Autos. Once some poor misguided folks cross that mixed-up dusty line they enter into a soul-sucking world called used cars sales. And now you are suggesting I take up selling used cars too? You are suggesting I sell my soul?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Eddie&rsquo;s face accomplished what was for him the near impossible: a darn-near real looking grin suddenly and briefly splashed across it. &ldquo;You-all plannin&rsquo; to twist that little knife you poked into my heart? Sell your soul? That is not the idea I have got in mind. I spent most a&rsquo; my lifetime building this here business, and I am offering to bring you in on it cheap. Nearly givin&rsquo; it over, just to know my life&rsquo;s work will last beyond my own days.&rdquo; Eddie slumped forward. His arms flopped free in front of his legs, outside of the elbows brushing the insides of his folded knees. He now looked like a plump formless puppet whose strings were cut.</p>\n<p>John Taylor Edgar glanced sidelong at him, trying to not react out of haste. He pushed a clump of his somewhat stringy blonde hair back across his shoulder, where it hung over his collar. Eddie remained folded for several minutes, until John Taylor Edgar finally spoke.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Guess I did not realize the full weight of my words. Was not trying to dismiss your life&rsquo;s work, or your internal feelings. Do not take it so bad. I do not mean it as bad as I might a&rsquo; spoke it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Eddie suddenly popped back upright. The once rare expression again quickly flitted onto his puffy face, and just as quickly disappeared. &ldquo;Now, to be straight, I ain&rsquo;t sold my soul. Never did any commerce with the devil, never had truck with any of Satan&rsquo;s angels.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I did not mean to state that you did. Hell, Eddie, until this morning I never knew you a-tall. I certainly can not be pronouncing on the state of your soul or suggesting that you keep company with the devil. I was just simply and plainly spouting my reaction to the notion you are suggesting.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Eddie laughed. It was a brief snorting sort of laugh, but sure seemed intended as an expression of amusement. Which is what John Taylor Edgar finally decided it was. &ldquo;I know used car folks do not carry high credit in most folks minds. Sort of in the company of ambulance chasers and politicians and teevee preachers. But I can account for at least one used car man&rsquo;s soul, and while it may be a fact that my soul is a bit bumped and bruised, I still got one. One day I will put it back on fully and wholly. From that day onward I will wear it. I will wear it to my grave and forevermore after that. What I am tryin&rsquo; to say is sometimes you got to stash your soul away while you get on with what you got to get on with, but you do not got to give it up for all eternity.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He sat back and slapped his hands on his knees. His thighs responded by quivering in ways that would have been distressing to observe were they not clothed in baggy oversized khaki trousers.</p>\n<p>Now, John Taylor Edgar Smith&rsquo;s thinking did not always fire on all cylinders. And John Taylor Edgar Smith was as apt to tie a mental granny knot as a square knot. But this time, somewhere deep inside that grey mash in his skull, the knot firmed up neat and square and all cylinders fired in proper synchrony.</p>\n<p>Eddie&rsquo;s innocuously profound statement and John Taylor Edgar&rsquo;s recent business dealings crossed paths in that grey mash which generally rested mostly dormant in his skull. Like old acquaintances whose paths cross unexpectedly, and who kind-of sort-of recognize some mostly forgotten commonality they may have shared at some forgotten point in the past, the two events circled back and stood toe to toe, belly to belly, nose to nose.</p>\n<p>And, suddenly, recognition happened. A flash of insight, bolt of lightning, bulb going on, eureka moment happened. Recognition of the intersection of ideas occurred in John Taylor Edgar Smith&rsquo;s head.</p>\n<p>John Taylor Edgar&rsquo;s revelation was simple yet profound. If you could stash your treasures at a pawnshop, if you could stash your soul on a shelf until once again it became useful and needed, why not stash your treasured soul at a pawnshop? And maybe pick up a different soul for your immediate needs? A soul pawnshop.</p>\n<p>And thus was planted the seed from which John Taylor Edgar Smith harvested his eventual fortune.</p>\n<p>-Your soul not working for you? Pawn it. Trade it for one that better suits.</p>\n<p>-Have an immediate need for financial help? Unlock the hidden value in your high-quality soul. Pawn it.</p>\n<p>-Wary of having no soul? Try out alternative souls until you find one that suits you.</p>\n<p>-Souls do not wear out. They may fray around the edges, but they remain functional. As functional as a soul ever can be, at least. A used soul might fit the bill for you.</p>\n<p>-Is your soul too constrictive, too tight? Trade it for a better fitting one.</p>\n<p>-Is your family disowning you thanks to your pathological behaviour? Try a fresh new carefully tended soul.</p>\n<p>The thoughts sprouted in John Taylor Edgar&rsquo;s mind in a feverish frenzied rush. An idea, a big hairy audacious idea, popped into his skull. This was so unexpected -John Taylor Edgar Smith rarely experienced an original thought- that he wondered if he was hallucinating.</p>\n<p>For several minutes John Taylor Edgar sat stock still, slumped forward, supported by his forearms crossed on his knees. He slowly pivoted his head towards Eddie. Eddie was alternately staring at John Taylor Edgar with a quizzical expression on his face and staring across the expanse of Eddie’s Autos to the distant hazy mountains. He slowly turned back to share Eddie’s gaze across the dust and dirt. John Taylor Edgar realized that Eddie thought he was seriously contemplating the soul-sucking offer.</p>\n<p>But what John Taylor Edgar was contemplating was the audacious idea forming in his grey matter. He slowly realized that, crazy and ridiculous as it was, he was just about crazy and ridiculous enough to try it. For the second time in a week he took decisive action. It was a rare event. One of a scant number of times in his life that he actually acted rather than wait for an excuse not to. The actual number of times he previously undertook a real action was in fact a number that might comfortably be counted on the digits of both hands, no need to pull off his shoes and use his toes as well. And sitting there looking at the sheer madness of the idea was almost enough to convince him to sit back and let it pass. But he did not. He could not. For once he could not and did not.</p>\n<p>John Taylor Edgar took the previously proffered offer from Eddie of Eddie’s Autos, Firestones be damned. Without further explanation about his sudden capitulation he stood, picked up the pile of crumpled bills sitting on the side counter, and shook Eddie’s hand.</p>\n<p>He sauntered over to the Buick and popped open the trunk. He leaned in and dragged a worn duffel bag out of the depths of the old beast. He dropped the bag into the dust next to the bumper and spun on his heels towards Eddie. With a slow-motion pitch he underhanded the keys across the dry earth between himself and a surprised Eddie. Eddie caught them and John Taylor Edgar nodded once, then reached down and hefted the bag.</p>\n<p>John Taylor Edgar walked to the line demarcating the real world from the Eddie’s Autos world. A hot dry wind pushed swirls of dust around his ankles. Across the road a tumbling sage skittered across the dry land, bound for nowhere but seemingly in a hurry to get there.</p>\n<p>He stopped and looked up the road, bending forward and peering as far as he could see. He then looked down the road the other way just as far as he could see. He toed the dust and dirt mixing at the boundaries of the two worlds. He stood for a moment, staring across the road into the distance.</p>\n<p>Finally he seemed satisfied with whatever he was contemplating. He spun to the right, shrugged the duffel bag strap onto his shoulder, and elbowed the bulk of the bag behind his back. He began trudging down the road like a man with a purpose. As he walked past the far corner of Eddie’s Autos he gave a backhand over-the-shoulder wave to Eddie. He knew Eddie saw it, for he could feel Eddie’s eyes boring into the back of his skull. He did not look back; did not need to. Souls were his future.</p>\n<p>END</p>",
				"content_text": "*a story*\n\nJohn Taylor Edgar Smith –always John Taylor Edgar; never Johnnie, or JT, or any other cut-rate variant of his full given name– was a dealer in cut-rate used souls. A soul pawnbroker. In fact, he pretty much developed the whole business of buying and selling used souls. He sort of backed into the niche while sort of trying to bail out what was left of his own soul.\n\nJohn Taylor Edgar Smith was not the first to make money in the soul business. Preachers and prophets have been dealing in souls for quite a while, engaging in things as morally and ethically questionable as selling dispensations to personages seeking an expedient pathway to eternal glory and everlasting grace without the bother of actually conducting their lives in a manner conducive to attaining eternal glory and everlasting grace.\n\nJohn Taylor Edgar Smith's forebears, many hops down his convoluted family tree, engaged in various and occasionally rather creative but inevitably dubious and/or nefarious activities, but they never dealt in the business of souls. Have to draw a line somewhere. Leave that business for the church.\n\nStill, the aptitude for behaviour outside the norm was deeply bred into him. Without really trying, he managed to live up to his familial heritage. Or down to it, depending on who was doing the observing. John Taylor Edgar Smith eventually managed to extend his heritage by devising a wholly new form of commerce.\n\nHe did so by developing the business of dealing in the shady world of soul-trading. Soul pawning. He essentially invented that world, and through sheer cussed perseverance built it into a tidy and extremely profitable business. There eventually came a time when you could find a John Taylor Edgar Smith Soul Brokerage(TM) in most any town of any reasonable size. Souls are abundant, as is misery and circumstance and bad luck.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nJohn Taylor Edgar's foray into the business of trading used souls stretched back a while. It stretched back to a time when he was really down, and just about out. It started from a confluence of events which could only happen to someone whose wingtips were scuffed and worn from frequent kicking against hard ground. Sometimes opportunity presents itself only to people in extraordinary circumstances. People who are getting by with some form of plain ordinary life don't generally find themselves in extraordinary circumstances.\n\nSome years back, things had not been going all that well in the plain ordinary business of John Taylor Edgar's life.\n\nWhat with more than a few ducked obligations and a surfeit of just plain ugly luck, his life's trajectory was less than stellar. In fact, until he entered the used soul world the high point of John Taylor Edgar's life was probably about two days before he emerged from his mother’s womb and found himself blinking up at the world. From that point on, until one dusty afternoon a long convoluted thirty-some years later, things in his life were on a steadily descending trajectory to nowhere.\n\nJohn Taylor Edgar's down-and-outedness eventually reached the point where he began pawning most of the portable articles in Darlene's house. Darlene was off spending a winter trying to save some poor lost heathen souls through the tired old method of patching holes in the tin siding and scrounged roofs of their poor dwellings. A handful of roofs got patched by Darlene and her soul-savers group, but few souls were actually saved. Meanwhile, John Taylor Edgar Smith was working on dismantling a major portion of the life she left behind.\n\nWhen Darlene slipped into her letters a line or two too many about how splendid Thomas was at the whole soul-saving business and how splendidly Thomas was showing her new ways to see the light, even in the pitch dark of a patched hut somewhere in the deep hinterlands of equatorial dark lands, and especially how much Thomas was into her, well, John Taylor Edgar could read between the lines of her ever-less frequent letters. He knew she did not mean Thomas was into her in a metaphorical sense.\n\nIt wasn't much of a surprise to him anyway.\n\nDarlene was becoming more uptight and naggy about John Taylor Edgar Smith's ways long before she went off to save heathen souls. It seemed to him she was just warming up for the big job: John Taylor Edgar Smith's soul. She had begun working on John Taylor Edgar and his misbegotten ways right away after she hooked up with the All World One Power Healing Ministry and started going to prayer meetings two, sometimes three times a week.\n\n\"Cut your hair and clean up your appearance, John Taylor Edgar Smith.\"\n\n\"Get a decent clean steady job, John Taylor Edgar Smith.\"\n\n\"Come to the prayer meeting with me and get straight in your life, John Taylor Edgar Smith.\"\n\nOne day Darlene came home with stars in her eyes and a new purpose for her life. \"We are called to grace. We are called to fix things for souls in dark lands, and show them the way to fix their souls. I am going to dark lands to heal souls and gain grace for my soul. Me and my Tuesday prayer and healing team are going to go ease the journey for a few tortured souls. But we will keep praying for your soul. Even when we are healing souls in dark lands, we will be seeking healing for your tortured soul back here.\"\n\nJohn Taylor Edgar waved goodbye to Darlene as she embarked for the distant shores. At first her letters came in waves, two or four at a time, one or two times per week. Then they came in trickles, no more than one or two per week.\n\nEventually even the trickle faded into the sand. Perhaps the hot sun of the dark lands evaporated the ink in her pen, John Taylor Edgar scoffed. He could read between the lines; he could read what she did not write.\n\n'Goodbye Darlene,' thought John Taylor Edgar after a couple of weeks went by without a letter.\n\nHe sat on the sagging orangey-yellow sofa in the small house they once shared. The room was steeped in twilight, which blended and blurred with the dimness within his mind. For a long time he stared at nothing in particular, lost in thoughts of nothing in particular. Gradually, his personal twilight faded. He looked about and saw his ticket to his own personal grace staring right back at him.\n\nJohn Taylor Edgar began to think Darlene surely did not need all those extra rings and blings she left behind, stashed in a shoebox at the bottom of a pile in the back of her closet.\n\nAnd she was not ever going to learn to play on her daddy's old guitar, no matter how many times she said she was. A custom-made 12-stringer, no less. Probably made with rare wood from an endangered tree cut down behind the patched hut in the dark lands where Darlene and Thomas were showing each other new ways to see the light in the middle of the dark equatorial night.\n\nIt was also likely that splendid Thomas would find no good use for that shotgun stashed in the closet. Best to get it out of the way before he tried to figure out how to point it and ended up blasting his foot off. Or blasting John Taylor Edgar's head off, if they happened to figure out that it was not a sneak-thief that made off with the dishes.\n\nOh, and John Taylor Edgar found the keys to the old Buick. Somehow they had ended up taped to the back of the refrigerator. As if he was not to be trusted with that old cranky Buick.\n\nNow that he had the keys he might as well borrow the blue Buick. After all, he could not very well carry all Darlene’s not-needed stuff on his person. Besides, an old vehicle, especially a Buick, needs to run occasionally, lest the rust and rot sets in. And they surely would not let him board the bus carrying a shotgun and a guitar and dragging a duffel or two. A man certainly needed some form of transportation. Even a rusty old Buick would suffice, given the right set of circumstances.\n\nSince splendid Thomas and Darlene would be used to seeking out a shady spot to rest over there in the dark lands, John Taylor Edgar might as well do her a favour and get that rusty old Buick out from under the shade tree back here at home. He could make room under the shade tree for a swing, or a blanket, or whatever else they were finding pleasure on over there in that dark village. Besides each other, of course.\n\nSo the old Buick became John Taylor Edgar Smith’s ride to Grace. On the road to Grace, he exhausted four different pawnshops while trying to spread the wealth around a bit. Interesting business, he was thinking after a hour of wrangling with the ornery old cuss at pawnshop no.2. Trade your old worn goods for some ready cash, with a promise that when you were flush again you could reclaim what was rightfully yours.\n\nOr what might rightfully have been Darlene's, as the case might be. But that is just details. Point was, here was a means to trade up or down, depending on your needs and abilities. Pick up serviceable goods that did not currently service their previous owners’ needs. Drop off serviceable goods that did not currently service their current owners’ needs. Not as much as cash did, at any rate. And coming up with cash was John Taylor Edgar's immediate goal.\n\nAnyway, after pawnshop no.4 the Buick was cleaned out and John Taylor Edgar's wallet was fatter than it had been in a long time. A long, long time. His wallet was now fat with dirty old Darlene-derived cash and the old Darlene Buick was clean.\n\nJohn Taylor Edgar’s last stop before entering into Grace was Eddie's Autos. -\"We pay top, We sell botton…\" - proclaimed a vintage billboard leaning lazily towards the road. The turn into Eddie's Autos popped up just before a big lazy westward turn on the road leading across the mountains and into Grace. Two roads diverged at the far side of Grace. He would make up his mind which one to take when he got there. Probably would not matter which one, he guessed.\n\nBy this time John Taylor Edgar was so ornery and worn out from so much fussing and arguing with cranky old cusses sitting on stools behind high counters trying to squeeze every last nickel out of each dime deal that he nearly immediately got right into Eddie of Eddie's Autos (\"We pay top, we sell botton…”).\n\nJohn Taylor Edgar got himself ready to give Eddie of Eddie’s Autos what-for about the old Buick, what with its clearly prime condition and state of mechanical functioning, almost as soon as Eddie started in with a clearly practiced routine of walking slowly 'round and 'round the old blue and white finned beast, shaking his head every few steps.\n\nJohn Taylor Edgar got good and annoyed with Eddie of Eddie's Autos pretty quick, what with Eddie muttering disparaging remarks and punctuating them with negative shakes of his head at about every second step.\n\n\"Not good, not good. Look at that old metal. Likely to be loose and rattly, leastways wherever it is not rusted up tighter’n a wrench can bust loose. Gonna be tough to move this beast. Not sure I wanna try. Least not for more than a few hundred.\" Eddie's mutterings were clearly meant to be overheard.\n\nEddie scuffed and kicked the dry dirt as he shuffled along. Pushed his fists deep into his faded khaki pockets, pulled them out to rap on a fender or poke at a tire, pushed them back into his khakis. Periodically he would stop, rock back on his heels, and slide his hands through his old dry leather suspenders and interlock them over his rather consequential belly. In this pose he would stand and stare at some object for an interval longer than seemed absolutely necessary for discerning whatever it was he obviously felt needed discerning.\n\n\"What is all that muttering supposed to mean? You are fixing to lowball me, that is what I reckon. And see that sign right up there? Ya’ll say ‘We pay top’! But it sounds like you got things a mite topsy-turvy. Sounds like you mean to pay me bottom so's you can sucker some bigger fool into paying you top. And what the smelly hell is a ‘botto’ anyway?” John Taylor Edgar tried to clue Eddie of Eddie’s Autos that he was not any old fool and Eddie of Eddie’s Autos should not expect to shake him down with ornery ways and obtuse shakes of his shiny fat head.\n\nWell, John Taylor Edgar and Eddie of Eddie's Autos went at it for hours, long and roundabout. It was a slow afternoon at Eddie's Autos, which John Taylor Edgar figured was often the case. And John Taylor Edgar was not in much of a hurry to get anywhere down the road, seeing as Darlene was not likely to be chasing after him all too soon and he had nowhere special -and nowhere non-special, come to think of it- he needed to be.\n\nEventually they stopped cussing at each other. They paused to draw breath, lean back in a pair of slowly rusting chairs on the shady side of Eddie's Autos, and down a pair of cold ones Eddie produced from a grimy top-load freezer hidden in plain sight in a dark dusty back corner of the dark dusty former shipping container now serving ignominiously as the Head Office for Eddie’s Autos. This grandiose statement the sign over the door proclaimed in faded and uneven brush strokes. John Taylor Edgar almost asked if the paint ran out while Eddie was scrawling the Head Office sign, or while he was splashing the word ‘bottom’ on the roadside sign.\n\nHead Office - Eddie's Autos. No mention that it was the only office for Eddie's Autos. It could equally say Tail Office - Eddie's Autos. One and Only Office - Eddie's Autos. Or just plain 'the office'. Small 't', small 'o'.\n\nEddie of Eddie's Autos tilted his head and looked sidelong at John Taylor Edgar. An awkward grimacing motion, probably a sort of malformed grin, tried to crawl onto his droopy wrinkly face. It did not succeed on account of the flaccid and flabby smile-forming muscles being long out of practice, but it was clearly a different sort of expression for Eddie's face and it clean stopped John Taylor Edgar right in the middle of his twelfth or fifteenth time of pointing out how much tread was left on those two Firestones on the front, which definitely added at least another $50 to the value of the old Buick, dang-it-all.\n\nEddie's wrangling suddenly moved from autos to souls. John Taylor Edgar's soul in particular, although neither Eddie nor John Taylor Edgar would have said so. Not at first. Eddie had not spent a couple of lifetimes hustling dollars from folks without picking up some tricks along the way. One of those tricks was the ability to ignore his culpability, aka his conscience. Perhaps aka his soul.\n\nJohn Taylor Edgar was the first to introduce the concept. \"Now let me get this idea straight in my head. Sounds like you are suggesting I sit here beside you each and every day, drumming up ways to squeeze an extra fifty or five hundred dollars out of folks who happen to need a barely running clunker and who happen to wander across the fine line separating Eddie's Autos from the real world.\"\n\nHe paused to swipe the back of his sleeve across the dust and sweat on the tip of his nose. \"That fine line I point to is the one out there where the dust at the edge of the road starts to mix with the dust from the potholes at the end of the turnout into Eddie's Autos. Once some poor misguided folks cross that mixed-up dusty line they enter into a soul-sucking world called used cars sales. And now you are suggesting I take up selling used cars too? You are suggesting I sell my soul?\"\n\nEddie's face accomplished what was for him the near impossible: a darn-near real looking grin suddenly and briefly splashed across it. \"You-all plannin' to twist that little knife you poked into my heart?

The once rare expression again quickly flitted onto his puffy face, and just as quickly disappeared. \"Now, to be straight, I ain't sold my soul. Never did any commerce with the devil, never had truck with any of Satan's angels.\"\n\n\"I did not mean to state that you did. Hell, Eddie, until this morning I never knew you a-tall. I certainly can not be pronouncing on the state of your soul or suggesting that you keep company with the devil.

This was so unexpected -John Taylor Edgar Smith rarely experienced an original thought- that he wondered if he was hallucinating.\n\nFor several minutes John Taylor Edgar sat stock still, slumped forward, supported by his forearms crossed on his knees.

Across the road a tumbling sage skittered across the dry land, bound for nowhere but seemingly in a hurry to get there.\n\nHe stopped and looked up the road, bending forward and peering as far as he could see. He then looked down the road the other way just as far as he could see. He toed the dust and dirt mixing at the boundaries of the two worlds. He stood for a moment, staring across the road into the distance.\n\nFinally he seemed satisfied with whatever he was contemplating. He spun to the right, shrugged the duffel bag strap onto his shoulder, and elbowed the bulk of the bag behind his back. He began trudging down the road like a man with a purpose. As he walked past the far corner of Eddie’s Autos he gave a backhand over-the-shoulder wave to Eddie. He knew Eddie saw it, for he could feel Eddie’s eyes boring into the back of his skull. He did not look back; did not need to. Souls were his future.\n\nEND\n",

				"content_html": "<p><em>a short story</em></p>\n<p>A frantic chirping echoed through the house. Roger heaved his creaky body out of the comfortable depths of the lumpy old sofa. He stood and waited for the blood to flow to his head before moving.</p>\n<p>“When exactly did that infernal warbling replace actual ring-ring?” he muttered half-aloud, not really expecting a sensible reply.</p>\n<p>Mumbling to himself was one of his new-found endearing traits, the latest in a series of provocative acts. Provocative, that is, if you were his daughter and you faced an ever-changing litany of &lsquo;character traits&rsquo; specifically intended to trigger a reaction. He would never admit it outright, but she was basically correct when she said he was simply trying to annoy her with all of his newfound tics and quirks.</p>\n<p>“They gradually snuck all these noise makers into our lives without telling us about the consequences. Before we realized what was going on everything was beeping and buzzing in its own damned irritating voice, with no way to tell them all to shut it.”</p>\n<p>He frantically looked around for the current source of irritation. Now that phones did not have leashes to tie them to one place they tended to wander around the house. On this particular morning six or seven chirps passed before he tracked the source of the noise to its latest hiding place, just as it gave up on him.</p>\n<p>He was starting to wonder what it was doing in the kitchen cupboard when another round of chirping interrupted him. When he picked up the phone the little screen flashed a name: Sandy.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Hey Dad! What is going on today?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Her perky voice erupted into his ear. Time for the regular check-in and grilling. For a change, he actually had something to talk about other than the tedious routines of a life lived small.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I am going to the bank and then I am going to that little café behind the bookstore. You know, the hippie place.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Why are you going there?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I am meeting someone. We are going to have coffee and scones and we are going to talk. Very adult-like, I am afraid. You probably would not be excited by it.”</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Who are you meeting? Someone I know? Someone from your old job?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;In reverse order: no, not yet, and Shelley.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Who is Shelley? I do not remember anyone named Shelley. Where is she from? How do you know each other?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Roger sighed. More and more it seemed to come to this: an interrogation, a cross-examination. Is this how kids get their revenge for all the concern you had when they were teens, by turning the tables and making you account for every move?</p>\n<p>No way he was going to slide gently into the role of an infirm incompetent old man answering his every action to his child. He tried a non-response.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So how are things down your way? It has been a while since you invited me down for a visit. You have not sold all your furniture, have you? Still have a spot for me to sit?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Nice try Dad. Who is Shelley?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He knew that tone in her voice - she was not going to back down. A siren in her background punctuated the silence, adding a note of official-sounding urgency to her question.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Shelley is an acquaintance of mine. She is quite attractive and intellectual and she is eager to meet me.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Eager to meet you! Dad, what are you talking about? You do not even know her?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yes I do. I have known her for a while. Maybe we have never met face to face, but that does not mean I do not know her.”</p>\n<p>He inwardly gloated while he prepared for Sandy&rsquo;s response. It had worked. He hid his slip-up of mentioning the bank behind a distraction. And casually throwing out a woman’s name was likely to be the biggest distraction he could have managed.</p>\n<p>“Maybe you have never met? How can there be a maybe about it? Either you have met or you have not. And how do you know someone if you have never seen their face, never looked into their eyes?”</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So the blind can never know someone?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Sandy groaned. Sometimes her father was so obtuse.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Are you blind?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You know the answer to that. Do not be a smart aleck.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So I am supposed to say nothing to your snappy comments? How is that fair?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I believe we have had the fairness conversation before. In case you do not recall, the usual conclusion is that life is not fair.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The conversation was temporarily limited to telephonic sounds of objects being moved and unseen actions making disembodied noises.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You know, I still remember Barry,” he said. “That&rsquo;s a few years back, mind you, but it could have been only yesterday.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Do not tell me you do not remember Barry. You had to —had to, mind you— go to your girlfriend&rsquo;s house for a vacation. This was six months after she moved halfway across the country.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You are talking about Mary Spencer? That was when I was 12.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, and you had to go halfway across the country to Mary&rsquo;s new house so you could meet this absolutely fabulous boy she kept telling you about. I am not sure how it was supposed to work, but I think you planned to fall in love and live happily ever after. Unfortunately, as you said, you were only 12. And you lived almost a thousand kilometres from him. But you knew this Barry boy was gorgeous and you just had to meet him. At that time you had never seen him.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She sighed. He smiled. He could not see her throw up her hands in a futile effort to gather some strength from the empty air, but he was pretty sure she was doing exactly that.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Ok, so Barry was a slob with bad teeth and smelly feet. Your point is?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;He had smelly feet? I never knew that. How did you find that out?”</p>\n<p>“Dad…”</p>\n<p>“Anyway, I always supposed that he was simply too much of a hick for a sophisticated girl like you. After all, he lived in the hinterlands. Not likely to appreciate the finer points of an urban girl, I expect.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Do not be cynical.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I am not being cynical. After all, I sent you on your little adventure. I knew you would have to discover some things for yourself. Things like truth in advertising. As I recall, the phone bills dropped quite a bit after that little adventure.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He could almost hear the exasperated smile creep across Sandy&rsquo;s face.</p>\n<p>She did not give him time to gloat. &ldquo;And Shelley&hellip; that is her name, right?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is her name. Shelley&rsquo;s name is Shelley.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;And Shelley is advertised how?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are sly. I always knew you would grow up to be a credit to your dad. That is me, by the way.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Really? Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Low blow. You have tried that one before, though. Quite a bit, in fact. Back when you were far too smart and sophisticated to have a dim bulb like me for your father. Fortunately, I found those smart pills. I seemed to have become tolerably rational by the time you turned twentyish.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The question, which you keep dodging, is who is Shelley.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;No, the question is how you discovered Barry had smelly feet. It is not a normal activity, smelling people&rsquo;s feet. Especially the feet of people you just met for the first time. After flying halfway across the country, I feel I must add once more.”</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So&hellip; Shelley.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So&hellip; Smelly.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You will not give up, will you?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Nope.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;All right. There was nothing to it. I met Barry at Mary&rsquo;s house. She invited him over so we could meet. Remember: she was the one who set me up to this whole thing. When Barry came in he flopped down on a big chair in that &lsquo;I&rsquo;m so cool&rsquo; way teenage boys have. When he kicked off his shoes it took about three seconds for the smell to hit us. I nearly gagged. I excused myself to go to the bathroom and I stayed there. I did not want to go back to that room while he was still there stinking it up. Eventually Mary came to get me and I convinced her to get rid of him. That was the end of Barry.”</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So the actual face-to-face with him was on the order of three seconds, give or take a few?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That is about right. The kicker is that Mary and I sort of kept in touch over the years, even though we were never close again. About ten years after my big meeting with gorgeous Barry I got her engagement announcement.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;She married Mr. Smelly Feet, right?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;How did you know?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I could see it coming.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What else can you see coming?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;More questions.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Can you see any answers to those questions following along, like sweepers following elephants in a parade?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Maybe. Depends on the tone of the questions. But first I need to do something. I am going to put the phone down. Will you be here when I get back?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Sort of depends on how long it is going to be. Where you going?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If you really want too much information, I need to pee.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Dad! Do not be crude.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You asked for answers. Be careful what you ask for.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Sandy’s sigh was long and clearly audible.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You know better than that. You think it is funny provoking me?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Not so much funny as easy. I seem to manage the feat simply by trying to live my own life. Now if you will excuse me, I do need to go. Unless you want to join me in the loo.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I will pass. Go. And while you go, prepare to provide me some simple answers.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>After a few minutes of background noises Sandy heard his returning footsteps, followed by a loud clatter.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Ouch! My poor ear,&rdquo; she protested, hoping to find some sympathy. Maybe if he felt a bit of guilt he would not act so darn stubborn.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Sorry, my dear girl. Phone slipped. But since you are listening through the speaker your ear will likely suffer little permanent damage.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I should know better than to try. After all these years you would think I would know my dad is omniscient.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;At last! I was wondering when you would get that through that thick blonde head of yours, cute as it is.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Where did you meet her?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, are we back to the topic of the day now?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Dadddy&hellip;”</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Do you think scones are a good idea? Or should I have something less likely to make crumbs? On the other hand, she did mention scones so maybe crumbs are not a problem for her.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Would it be better if I did not react so you get over having your jollies at my expense?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;An interesting idea. When shall we try it?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;My scone choice would be cranberry orange, unless you need to appear conservative. After all, I do not know what sort of person this Shelley is. Other than crazy, or desperate, or maybe both, for agreeing to meet you.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Well played. By the time you decide to grow up and become a sharp septuagenarian like me, you will be handling all the curveballs with ease. And to answer your ninth question —yes, I kept count— we met when Shelley left some thoughtful and perceptive comments on my blog. She is quite literate and not noticeably crazy.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Your what?!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;My blog. Short for weblog, although people forget that. Online places where people write about things that interest them.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I know what a blog is. I was responding to your oh-so casual remark about your blog. What is this? Since when? What do you blog about?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So many questions. Reminds me of when you were three. That was only what, forty years ago?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Thirty eight. And we are not talking about that right now. We are talking about this blog news. Tell me about it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It is all there online. It might be easier if you read it yourself.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Easier for whom?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;For me. For you. For Richard. Or is it Robert now? I get confused. The recent one, the one you met online. I think it was on that dating service for married people.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Sandy’s cup hit the table a bit harder than she intended.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So this is your first date, I take it. Did you pick the café so you can make a quick getaway?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It was her idea. And we do not call it a date.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What was her idea?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Us meeting. The café was my idea. The scones were hers.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>“And you are after what, exactly? I do not remember you as much of a ladies man. There was that frizzy-headed dumpling a few years back, but not much since. She was pushing real hard to move in, if I recall correctly. Gabby one. Tried way too hard. Lasted a few months before you smartened up and said bye-bye to her. We would have to go back a few more years to find her predecessor. You really do not get around much, so of course I am interested.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Nosey, you mean. You think it is possible that perhaps I have been with women you do not know about? That maybe I have a life outside of your all-encompassing sphere of knowledge?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I suppose it is possible, but it would be quite out of character. I do not remember much female influence around while I was growing up. It worked out, so I am not complaining, but I did sometimes think it was strange how we existed without female influence when none of my friends did.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Well, you were always my number one concern and consideration. And I remember you were never too keen on sharing me with anyone. Somehow I managed. Do not forget you spent a few weeks each year with your grandparents. You think I just sat around in the dark all the times you were gone?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It is possible, knowing you.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;But not probable, knowing me. Whether you liked it or not I was a lively young man. I was a single father in an age when that was still unusual, but it actually worked in my favour. Women seemed to feel I needed female advice and comfort since I had a young daughter and no woman to help me. Poor Roger; he needs a woman&rsquo;s touch. You probably do not want to know all that may or may not have happened while you were at school or at sleepovers or finding other ways to escape your crazy father.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;May have? Or did?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Time to move the conversation elsewhere, Sandy decided. Either that or hang up. The putative sex life of your parent was never a comfortable topic.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Scones will be fine. Do not try to shove it all in your mouth in two bites and do not talk with your mouth full. As long as you are not spitting crumbs all over the table, or all over this woman, scone crumbs will not be a big problem. What sort of impression are trying to make? What is your intention? And do not tell me you are looking for a sex partner. That is a bit too much information. Sorry.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Why should I not enjoy a little physical closeness? I am not dead, you know. I can still do things. But that is not my motivation. I am looking for bit of stimulating conversation. I would not mind having a new partner to spar with. Someone to walk alongside on a South Pacific beach. Which, by the way, is part of my plan. You and I, we are sort of stuck in a rut. Have been for quite some time, in fact. It goes something like this: you try to convince me that I cannot possibly manage without you telling me what is best for me, and I try to remind you that I still have my wits about me. All this back-and-forth ends with me trying to annoy and provoke you simply to remind you that I know you better than anyone, possibly even including yourself. All the while you try to convince me that without you I would be doing little else but drooling on myself while sitting motionless for hours on a bench.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, I doubt that you would be motionless.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;But you do not dispute the drooling part.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>“Can we move on?”</p>\n<p>He was not ready to let her off. &ldquo;After Mr. Smelly Feet there was a regular parade of peacocks through our house. Remember? It got so bad I took the mirror out of the hall so they would just leave without spending several minutes primping before they met their adoring public. I guess that is part of the price of having a pretty daughter. All the pretty boys wanted to be with pretty girls. You were never lonely.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Were you jealous?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Perhaps. Are you jealous now? Why the concern about my morning?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Just trying to keep up with your busy social scene in case you need rescuing. Some of those older women are pretty aggressive. Especially when they spot an eligible and active man.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Well, I do not think I need to be rescued today. I will let you know if I need you to run interference. But do not wait up. And funny that you assume Shelley is an older woman.”</p>\n<p>“Daadd…”</p>\n<p>“So what do you think? Clean t-shirt, or same one I have worn for the last two weeks? Holes ok, or must I find one without holes? And do I need socks?”</p>\n<p>“Ok. You are just trying to irritate me now.”</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Now and always. That is my mission in life. You were right when you said so back when you were about fifteen or so. But I was sworn to secrecy. I could not tell you before. It says so in the preface to The Parents Guide to Tormenting Your Child.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Which you memorized.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Obviously.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Dad. I love you too.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What did I do now? Because I need to know if I should do it again or not.”</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yes. Do it again. Or not. Your choice. But call me and let me know if you are heading off to the South Pacific with this never-yet-met woman so I can feed the cat or pet the plant or whatever.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He smiled to himself. She certainly was his daughter. Zeroed right in on the most likely far-out scenario.</p>\n<p>He hesitated. The pause in the conversation grew painful.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I am not being ridiculous, am I?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She heard the sad and lonely tone lurking behind his plaintive question.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;No, Dad. You are not ridiculous. Spread crumbs all over your lap and do not worry about it. Brush them from your beard, though. You do not have to try to impress anyone. I am sure Shelley will be dazzled by your wit and erudition. A crumb or two will not change who you are. And if it does, she was wrong for you.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I see you are on a first name basis with her already. Great! I would invite you along on our South Pacific getaway, but I should get her consent first.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Just keep your eyes open and your brain functioning this morning.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Would it change your opinion if I told you she has her own jet?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Really? She has a private jet?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;No. The question was hypothetical. Rhetorical.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Ok, got it. I will stop with the skepticism now.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Do not ever stop caring. Just allow me to have a bit of life. My own life. Unless you are ready to move up here to the boring part of the world where I exist so you can brush the crumbs off my sweater all the time, let me bumble along in my own foolish way. I promise not to embarrass you. Not too much, anyway.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Sandy sighed. She picked up her coffee and strolled over to the window. After a quick glance down at the street she pulled the sash down.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It just got quiet.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I closed the window. I have to go soon.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Good. I mean, not good that you have to go soon. Good that I do not have to compete with the world for your attention. And where are you going?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;To meet someone.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;To meet someone. Do I interrogate you now or just wait for you to tell me?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You can wait.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Story of my life. Always waiting for a beautiful woman to come around.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I can come this weekend and we can have dinner. My treat. How about that? I will even watch for any stray crumbs. No extra charge.”</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I might even change my shirt for you. But I will have to get back to you. Might be doing something with Shelley.”</p>\n<p>She laughed. “Sure. Like pretending you are wiggling your toes in the sand. Anyway, go have your scone. And have fun. I will talk to you later.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I know. And you will be expecting a full report. I love you, my little girl. And remember: always be kind, considerate&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She chimed in, &ldquo;&hellip;and helpful. Yes, I remember. How could I forget? I have heard that since I was in pre-school. But I am no longer a little girl.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You will always be my little girl. Will not matter how much time or distance intercedes.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Ok, Dad. Love you too. Say hi to Shelly for me, if you dare. I will see you soon.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The connection clicked away.</p>\n<p>As he returned the phone to its base he sighed with relief. Sandy had not asked about the bank. Now he just had to figure out how to get in touch with her when he arrived. And he would have to ask Shelley if they could get cranberry orange scones in Tahiti.</p>",

And you lived almost a thousand kilometres from him. But you knew this Barry boy was gorgeous and you just had to meet him. At that time you had never seen him.\"\n\nShe sighed. He smiled. He could not see her throw up her hands in a futile effort to gather some strength from the empty air, but he was pretty sure she was doing exactly that.\n\n\"Ok, so Barry was a slob with bad teeth and smelly feet. Your point is?\"\n\n\"He had smelly feet? I never knew that. How did you find that out?”\n\n“Dad…”\n\n“Anyway, I always supposed that he was simply too much of a hick for a sophisticated girl like you. After all, he lived in the hinterlands. Not likely to appreciate the finer points of an urban girl, I expect.\"\n\n\"Do not be cynical.\"\n\n\"I am not being cynical. After all, I sent you on your little adventure. I knew you would have to discover some things for yourself. Things like truth in advertising. As I recall, the phone bills dropped quite a bit after that little adventure.\"\n\nHe could almost hear the exasperated smile creep across Sandy's face.\n\nShe did not give him time to gloat. \"And Shelley... that is her name, right?\"\n\n\"Yes, that is her name. Shelley's name is Shelley.\"\n\n\"And Shelley is advertised how?\"\n\n\"Oh, you are sly. I always knew you would grow up to be a credit to your dad. That is me, by the way.\"\n\n\"Really? Are you sure?\"\n\n\"Low blow. You have tried that one before, though. Quite a bit, in fact. Back when you were far too smart and sophisticated to have a dim bulb like me for your father. Fortunately, I found those smart pills. I seemed to have become tolerably rational by the time you turned twentyish.\"\n\n\"The question, which you keep dodging, is who is Shelley.\"\n\n\"No, the question is how you discovered Barry had smelly feet. It is not a normal activity, smelling people's feet. Especially the feet of people you just met for the first time. After flying halfway across the country, I feel I must add once more.”\n\n\"So... Shelley.\"\n\n\"So... Smelly.\"\n\n\"You will not give up, will you?\"\n\n\"Nope.\"\n\n\"All right. There was nothing to it. I met Barry at Mary's house. She invited him over so we could meet. Remember: she was the one who set me up to this whole thing. When Barry came in he flopped down on a big chair in that 'I'm so cool' way teenage boys have. When he kicked off his shoes it took about three seconds for the smell to hit us. I nearly gagged. I excused myself to go to the bathroom and I stayed there. I did not want to go back to that room while he was still there stinking it up. Eventually Mary came to get me and I convinced her to get rid of him. That was the end of Barry.”\n\n\"So the actual face-to-face with him was on the order of three seconds, give or take a few?\"\n\n\"That is about right. The kicker is that Mary and I sort of kept in touch over the years, even though we were never close again. About ten years after my big meeting with gorgeous Barry I got her engagement announcement.\"\n\n\"She married Mr. Smelly Feet, right?\"\n\n\"How did you know?\"\n\n\"I could see it coming.\"\n\n\"What else can you see coming?\"\n\n\"More questions.\"\n\n\"Can you see any answers to those questions following along, like sweepers following elephants in a parade?\"\n\n\"Maybe. Depends on the tone of the questions. But first I need to do something. I am going to put the phone down. Will you be here when I get back?\"\n\n\"Sort of depends on how long it is going to be. Where you going?\"\n\n\"If you really want too much information, I need to pee.\"\n\n\"Dad! Do not be crude.\"\n\n\"You asked for answers. Be careful what you ask for.\"\n\nSandy’s sigh was long and clearly audible.\n\n\"You know better than that. You think it is funny provoking me?\"\n\n\"Not so much funny as easy. I seem to manage the feat simply by trying to live my own life. Now if you will excuse me, I do need to go. Unless you want to join me in the loo.\"\n\n\"I will pass. Go. And while you go, prepare to provide me some simple answers.\"\n\nAfter a few minutes of background noises Sandy heard his returning footsteps, followed by a loud clatter.\n\n\"Ouch! My poor ear,\" she protested, hoping to find some sympathy. Maybe if he felt a bit of guilt he would not act so darn stubborn.\n\n\"Sorry, my dear girl. Phone slipped. But since you are listening through the speaker your ear will likely suffer little permanent damage.\"\n\n\"I should know better than to try. After all these years you would think I would know my dad is omniscient.\"\n\n\"At last! I was wondering when you would get that through that thick blonde head of yours, cute as it is.\"\n\n\"Where did you meet her?\"\n\n\"Oh, are we back to the topic of the day now?\"\n\n\"Dadddy...”\n\n\"Do you think scones are a good idea? Or should I have something less likely to make crumbs? On the other hand, she did mention scones so maybe crumbs are not a problem for her.\"\n\n\"Would it be better if I did not react so you get over having your jollies at my expense?\"\n\n\"An interesting idea. When shall we try it?\"\n\n\"My scone choice would be cranberry orange, unless you need to appear conservative. After all, I do not know what sort of person this Shelley is. Other than crazy, or desperate, or maybe both, for agreeing to meet you.\"\n\n\"Well played. By the time you decide to grow up and become a sharp septuagenarian like me, you will be handling all the curveballs with ease. And to answer your ninth question —yes, I kept count— we met when Shelley left some thoughtful and perceptive comments on my blog. She is quite literate and not noticeably crazy.\"\n\n\"Your what?!\"\n\n\"My blog. Short for weblog, although people forget that. Online places where people write about things that interest them.\"\n\n\"I know what a blog is. I was responding to your oh-so casual remark about your blog. What is this? Since when? What do you blog about?\"\n\n\"So many questions. Reminds me of when you were three. That was only what, forty years ago?\"\n\n\"Thirty eight. And we are not talking about that right now. We are talking about this blog news. Tell me about it.\"\n\n\"It is all there online. It might be easier if you read it yourself.\"\n\n\"Easier for whom?\"\n\n\"For me. For you. For Richard. Or is it Robert now? I get confused. The recent one, the one you met online. I think it was on that dating service for married people.\"\n\nSandy’s cup hit the table a bit harder than she intended.\n\n\"So this is your first date, I take it. Did you pick the café so you can make a quick getaway?\"\n\n\"It was her idea. And we do not call it a date.\"\n\n\"What was her idea?\"\n\n\"Us meeting. The café was my idea. The scones were hers.\"\n\n“And you are after what, exactly? I do not remember you as much of a ladies man. There was that frizzy-headed dumpling a few years back, but not much since. She was pushing real hard to move in, if I recall correctly. Gabby one. Tried way too hard. Lasted a few months before you smartened up and said bye-bye to her. We would have to go back a few more years to find her predecessor. You really do not get around much, so of course I am interested.\"\n\n\"Nosey, you mean. You think it is possible that perhaps I have been with women you do not know about? That maybe I have a life outside of your all-encompassing sphere of knowledge?\"\n\n\"I suppose it is possible, but it would be quite out of character. I do not remember much female influence around while I was growing up. It worked out, so I am not complaining, but I did sometimes think it was strange how we existed without female influence when none of my friends did.\"\n\n\"Well, you were always my number one concern and consideration. And I remember you were never too keen on sharing me with anyone. Somehow I managed. Do not forget you spent a few weeks each year with your grandparents. You think I just sat around in the dark all the times you were gone?\"\n\n\"It is possible, knowing you.\"\n\n\"But not probable, knowing me. Whether you liked it or not I was a lively young man. I was a single father in an age when that was still unusual, but it actually worked in my favour. Women seemed to feel I needed female advice and comfort since I had a young daughter and no woman to help me. Poor Roger; he needs a woman's touch. You probably do not want to know all that may or may not have happened while you were at school or at sleepovers or finding other ways to escape your crazy father.\"\n\n\"May have? Or did?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nTime to move the conversation elsewhere, Sandy decided. Either that or hang up. The putative sex life of your parent was never a comfortable topic.\n\n\"Scones will be fine. Do not try to shove it all in your mouth in two bites and do not talk with your mouth full. As long as you are not spitting crumbs all over the table, or all over this woman, scone crumbs will not be a big problem. What sort of impression are trying to make? What is your intention? And do not tell me you are looking for a sex partner. That is a bit too much information. Sorry.\"\n\n\"Why should I not enjoy a little physical closeness? I am not dead, you know. I can still do things. But that is not my motivation. I am looking for bit of stimulating conversation. I would not mind having a new partner to spar with. Someone to walk alongside on a South Pacific beach. Which, by the way, is part of my plan. You and I, we are sort of stuck in a rut. Have been for quite some time, in fact. It goes something like this: you try to convince me that I cannot possibly manage without you telling me what is best for me, and I try to remind you that I still have my wits about me. All this back-and-forth ends with me trying to annoy and provoke you simply to remind you that I know you better than anyone, possibly even including yourself. All the while you try to convince me that without you I would be doing little else but drooling on myself while sitting motionless for hours on a bench.\"\n\n\"Oh, I doubt that you would be motionless.\"\n\n\"But you do not dispute the drooling part.\"\n\n“Can we move on?”\n\nHe was not ready to let her off. \"After Mr. Smelly Feet there was a regular parade of peacocks through our house. Remember? It got so bad I took the mirror out of the hall so they would just leave without spending several minutes primping before they met their adoring public. I guess that is part of the price of having a pretty daughter. All the pretty boys wanted to be with pretty girls. You were never lonely.\"\n\n\"Were you jealous?\"\n\n\"Perhaps. Are you jealous now? Why the concern about my morning?\"\n\n\"Just trying to keep up with your busy social scene in case you need rescuing. Some of those older women are pretty aggressive. Especially when they spot an eligible and active man.\"\n\n\"Well, I do not think I need to be rescued today. I will let you know if I need you to run interference. But do not wait up. And funny that you assume Shelley is an older woman.”\n\n“Daadd…”\n\n“So what do you think? Clean t-shirt, or same one I have worn for the last two weeks? Holes ok, or must I find one without holes? And do I need socks?”\n\n“Ok. You are just trying to irritate me now.”\n\n\"Now and always. That is my mission in life. You were right when you said so back when you were about fifteen or so. But I was sworn to secrecy. I could not tell you before. It says so in the preface to The Parents Guide to Tormenting Your Child.\"\n\n\"Which you memorized.\"\n\n\"Obviously.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Dad. I love you too.\"\n\n\"What did I do now? Because I need to know if I should do it again or not.”\n\n\"Yes. Do it again. Or not. Your choice. But call me and let me know if you are heading off to the South Pacific with this never-yet-met woman so I can feed the cat or pet the plant or whatever.\"\n\nHe smiled to himself. She certainly was his daughter. Zeroed right in on the most likely far-out scenario.\n\nHe hesitated. The pause in the conversation grew painful.\n\n\"I am not being ridiculous, am I?\"\n\nShe heard the sad and lonely tone lurking behind his plaintive question.\n\n\"No, Dad. You are not ridiculous. Spread crumbs all over your lap and do not worry about it. Brush them from your beard, though. You do not have to try to impress anyone. I am sure Shelley will be dazzled by your wit and erudition. A crumb or two will not change who you are. And if it does, she was wrong for you.\"\n\n\"I see you are on a first name basis with her already. Great! I would invite you along on our South Pacific getaway, but I should get her consent first.\"\n\n\"Just keep your eyes open and your brain functioning this morning.\"\n\n\"Would it change your opinion if I told you she has her own jet?\"\n\n\"Really? She has a private jet?\"\n\n\"No. The question was hypothetical. Rhetorical.\"\n\n\"Ok, got it. I will stop with the skepticism now.\"\n\n\"Do not ever stop caring. Just allow me to have a bit of life. My own life. Unless you are ready to move up here to the boring part of the world where I exist so you can brush the crumbs off my sweater all the time, let me bumble along in my own foolish way. I promise not to embarrass you. Not too much, anyway.\"\n\nSandy sighed. She picked up her coffee and strolled over to the window. After a quick glance down at the street she pulled the sash down.\n\n\"It just got quiet.\"\n\n\"I closed the window. I have to go soon.\"\n\n\"Good. I mean, not good that you have to go soon. Good that I do not have to compete with the world for your attention. And where are you going?\"\n\n\"To meet someone.\"\n\n\"To meet someone. Do I interrogate you now or just wait for you to tell me?\"\n\n\"You can wait.\"\n\n\"Story of my life. Always waiting for a beautiful woman to come around.\"\n\n\"I can come this weekend and we can have dinner. My treat. How about that? I will even watch for any stray crumbs. No extra charge.”\n\n\"I might even change my shirt for you. But I will have to get back to you. Might be doing something with Shelley.”\n\nShe laughed. “Sure. Like pretending you are wiggling your toes in the sand. Anyway, go have your scone. And have fun. I will talk to you later.\"\n\n\"I know. And you will be expecting a full report. I love you, my little girl. And remember: always be kind, considerate...\"\n\nShe chimed in, \"...and helpful. Yes, I remember. How could I forget? I have heard that since I was in pre-school. But I am no longer a little girl.\"\n\n\"You will always be my little girl. Will not matter how much time or distance intercedes.\"\n\n\"Ok, Dad. Love you too. Say hi to Shelly for me, if you dare. I will see you soon.\"\n\nThe connection clicked away.\n\nAs he returned the phone to its base he sighed with relief. Sandy had not asked about the bank. Now he just had to figure out how to get in touch with her when he arrived. And he would have to ask Shelley if they could get cranberry orange scones in Tahiti.\n\n",

You cannot know the vast difference between being alive and being not alive until you experience it.\n\nWhen my life ended a thought flashed through my mind. \"This cannot be happening. I cannot end like this. I have too many things still to do. Too many things left unsaid. Too many things undone. I have too much life left to live, too much love yet to share. I am not ready for the end.\"\n\nMy objections did not matter. My new situation could not be undone.\n\nHow had this... unfortunate... state of affairs happened?\n\nA new view of my former world, my last moments, appeared. I saw, in agonizing detail, a gust of wind, strong, unyielding, slam into the sheltering tree above us. Unseen and unheard, a weak limb yielded to the incorporeal force. Gravity taking hold, the limb plummeted to earth. Unfortunately, I was standing between the limb and the earth. I tried to shout a warning. I had no mouth; I had no shout.\n\nAnd now we circle back to my new situation. Something -everything- had changed. Everything felt so strange.\n\nIt struck me. No pun intended. My world was now empty; hollow; a void. Everything and everyone I had known was gone from me, and me from them. In the middle of a single superb moment of happiness everything had changed. I was tasting a pair of desirable lips; I was feeling the first pangs of love, and it was cruelly taken from me.\n\nWould it have killed anyone to let me be for a while? A few more years. That is what I need. That is what I want. Even a few more days, a few hours. Would it kill anybody to give me at least a few more achingly beautiful joyful hours? That is not really too much to ask, is it?\n\nI would spend them dancing, extending my final moments of joy until eternity claimed us. Eternity would claim us; it always does.\n\n---\n",

				"content_html": "<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->a short story<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>The old man glanced over the top of his book and across the table. He looked at the lithe young cat sitting in front of the window, erect and prim-looking.</p>\n<p>“You know you are not supposed to be up there.”</p>\n<p>He tried to impress the cat with his mock irritation. He reached across and scratched her head for a moment before nudging her off the table, saying “Down!”</p>\n<p>“Talk about mixed messages”, he muttered. “No wonder they have control of the place.”</p>\n<p>The cat climbed onto the opposite chair and looked across the table at him. She decided not to push the situation. Instead, she climbed down and walked around the table to his chair. She stretched up to his thigh and softly touched it with her front paws. When he shifted slightly, she took it as encouragement and lightly sprang to his lap. He lightly and absent-mindedly fluffed her back while continuing to read the paper.</p>\n<p>The old man took his hand off the young cat and reached around the book for his cup. It felt light in his hand. He sighed. He could not recall drinking any of it and now it was almost empty.</p>\n<p>After setting the cup down he absent-mindedly ran his finger around the rim. When his finger ran across the chipped area he stopped and picked the cup up again. Peering at it to see if the old chip had enlarged into a crack, he turned it over to see the opposite side. The last of the cold tea spilled onto the book in front of him and ran down towards his lap. Oddly embarrassed, since there was no one other than the cat to observe his clumsy action, he quickly set the cup down and harrumphed.</p>\n<p>He folded the paper and laid it down. He removed his glasses. With his now-naked eyes he stared out the window, looking through blurry eyes at the lake. He sat and stared at it for a couple of minutes. Finally, he shook his head in a vain attempt to shake off unwanted thoughts.</p>\n<p>“So where is your brother now? You two were sure going at it a few minutes ago. Did you wear him out already? You know you need to have a bit more respect for us old ones.”</p>\n<p>He stroked her head, then scratched under her chin. She raised her chin in a gesture of cat ecstasy. Her purr motor came to life as he indulged her for a minute, and as he indulged her he felt a sense of peace mixed with loneliness.</p>\n<p>The old man eyed the young cat and wondered who was really getting the better part of the deal. Was it the free-loading cats in his house, or himself? He felt a twinge of guilt and anxiety. Had he the right to consider only himself, and not consider the wishes and needs of his companions?</p>\n<p>While he, like most humans, was blind to the fact that cats might have wishes and needs beyond those that humans ascribed to them, he did ascribe to them basic emotions such as loss, longing, and the capacity to care. In this fashion he elevated them above the level of dumb brutes. In his capacity to believe that they might care, might feel loss and longing, he also elevated himself above the level of dumb brute.</p>\n<p>But the cats had no real say, no real control, over their situation. Unless they were willing and able to strike out on their own, to become feral or to purr their way into a new situation of their own choosing, they were basically at his mercy. He felt a pang in his heart.</p>\n<p>He wandered into the study. It was a room overflowing with memories. His books; Alex’s books. Maya’s books, full of stories he had read, re-read, re-read, when little Maya was a sponge for words. Pictures. Hand-drawn elementary art and sophisticated college sketches. Photos. First days, last days, momentous events. He took a box of snapshots off a shelf and randomly pulled some out.</p>\n<p>After wandering through the box of memories for close to an hour the old man, also known as Sam, set aside the photos. He sighed. Time to set aside the memories and to move on. The slow decay of memories and an aching for what he could no longer have would have to reach an end.</p>\n<p>Sam thought of how he had encouraged Maya to look forward and try to act in her long-term interest. After years, a lifetime, of prescribing a positive and active course, it was time for him to mix in a few drams of sugar to leaven the bitterness of inaction and uselessness.</p>\n<p>It was time to follow his oft-stated prescription. Act. Act, not react, dammit it. Determine one’s own course, rather than be swept along by events and actions of others. Decide where to go, how to get there, what to do there. And then do it. Be true, be content, maybe even be happy, but certainly try to be useful.</p>\n<p>These thoughts swept in a fresh wave of nostalgia, remembrances of younger days when the centre of the world had been his women. The reality was they were gone. One had purported to be his life-partner, but in the end that was not true. He was sad, and his sadness was tinged with anger. Anger that his life had continued without her. It was not that she set out to deceive him, for her body had deceived her as well, and too soon. She was gone before either of them was ready for it. She died with so much life yet unlived and with great angst at leaving him and Maya.</p>\n<p>The old cat, the young cat, the photo boxes, the nostalgia. These things had to be left behind. He knew the cats would be safe and loved, though neither Maya nor they yet knew they were joining forces. Hardest of all, even Maya, his reason for going on, had to be left behind. After all, the past, and even the present, could be a drag on living. You could not progress far if you were trailing an anchor behind you, slowing your progress and hindering your forward movement. Not that Maya or the cats were drags on his life; not at all. They had kept him going for a long time after Alex was gone. He feared he was about to betray them by his actions.</p>\n<p>“Better to act now while I can think clearly. Look at George&hellip; He was betrayed by his mind before he was able to do anything about it. I won’t let that happen to me. I am not going to go like that. Sitting in a chair all day, drooling on myself and not caring. Shitting myself and not knowing. That is not for me.” He no longer felt silly talking to the cats.</p>\n<p>George’s metamorphosis was essentially complete. First he lost any semblance of his old mind. Gradually, then fast, he had lost his awareness of the world around him. The alteration in George had been insidious, a creeping loss of function. It had been so painful to watch, especially after the loss of Alex.</p>\n<p>Alex was still vibrant and active, acutely aware of the world and interacting with it right to the moment she left it. It was not fair. George, who was now nobody, was trapped in that old body of his, lingering as a shell of a person. It was enough to scare Sam into action. Drastic action. Sam was not going to drool his last years away, a nobody trapped in a human shell.</p>\n<p>Alex had gone the right way. Quick, active, living until the very moment of dying. It was the right way if you had a choice. How was he, Sam, aka the old man, going to end? Not passively declining. Not slowly sliding into lonely bitterness. When Alex died he had resolved to control his life right to the very end, just as she had. He was not going to sit around doing the same old things in the same old way with the same old people at the same old places. Sit and watch as they disappeared to a dark hole one by one. When it was his turn he would not shirk; he would not shriek. But he was certainly not planning to sit around wasting what time he had, waiting for his box to be dragged out to the mud.</p>\n<p>He looked at the framed pictures on the shelves for several minutes: young Alex and young Sam on a high rocky ledge. A slightly older Alex by a forested stream, holding little Maya. An older Maya looking back at Sam and Alex as she was leaving for her first day at high school. Maya and Alex at college graduation.</p>\n<p>Both of his women, the centres of his life, left him behind. Maya stopped by occasionally. She was still sort of available, but she had her own life to live. Alex was available only in pictures and memories. That was what was left: memories and occasional moments. That, and time. Time for loneliness, time for aimless wandering, time for thinking.</p>\n<p>He knew he spent too much time in the last few years being lost. Lost in loneliness, lost in thought. He tried to keep active, tried to keep his days full, but there was a hollowness pervading everything. More and more he felt that he was betraying Alex. He had let his time, and even his life, slip into greyness and meaninglessness. He told himself that he was holding on for Maya, but perhaps he was not. Perhaps he was holding her back.</p>\n<p>Sam sighed. He sat at the desk and opened the second drawer. He took out a sheet of the good paper. He dug under the stack and found a matching envelope. From the middle drawer he removed his Waterman. He placed the paper on his desk and uncapped the pen. For a moment he reminisced. Maya had given him the pen for his 60th birthday, back when time still to come stretched long.</p>\n<p>He gripped the pen and tried to feel Maya’s touch on its smooth barrel. He felt, or imagined he did, a bit of her spirit permeating the pen. He was sure it had not been a quick, almost thoughtless, purchase. No, she had been thinking of him. She had seen him stroking its nib across the paper when she bought it. And now her touch flowed from it, flowed into his fingertips. It was ironic that he would be sending her this message using the tool she provided.</p>\n<p>Sam scratched the nib across the paper to start the flow of ink. He wrote a simple message: “I have lived, I have loved, I have lost. Now it is time for me to find a new way.”</p>\n<p>He folded the page, put it in an envelope, and pressed the flap closed.
